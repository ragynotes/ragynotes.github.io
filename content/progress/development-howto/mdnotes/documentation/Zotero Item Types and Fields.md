# Zotero Item Types and Fields

This page provides general descriptions of Zotero item types and fields. It can be helpful when entering item data into Zotero manually. The  page also provides guidance on ways to store information for unusual  item types.

## Item Types

Item types in Zotero should be regarded as flexible, broad categories.  Item types are generally determined based on how items should be cited.  See descriptions of Zotero’s item types below. If you are citing an  unusual item type that does not perfectly fit one of the supported  categories, choose an item type that is reasonably close with an  adequate selection of fields (e.g., `Book`, `Report`, or `Manuscript` can be made to fit most unusual item types well).

You can store more specific information about the type of item (e.g., a  novel versus a biography book) in the Type, Format, or Extra fields or  using [tags](https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags#tags).

| Item Type            | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Artwork              | A piece of artwork  (e.g., an oil painting, photograph, or sculpture). Also use this item  type for other types of images or visual items (e.g., scientific  figures). |
| Audio Recording      | Any form of  audio recording, including music, spoken word, sound effects, archival  recordings, or audio-based scientific figures. |
| Bill                 | A proposed piece of legislation.                             |
| Blog Post            | An article or entry posted to a personal blog website. For online articles published as  part of a larger online publication (e.g., [NYT Blogs](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/blogs/directory.html)), using `Magazine Article` or `Newspaper Article` generally yields better results. |
| Book                 | A book or similar published item. For government documents, technical reports, manuals, etc., use `Report` instead. This item type can also be adapted to fit many types of unusual items. |
| Book Section         | A section of a book. Usually chapters, but also forewords, prefaces, introductions, appendices, afterwords, comments, etc. |
| Case                 | A legal case, either published or unpublished.               |
| Conference Paper     | A paper  presented at a conference and subsequently published in a formal  conference proceedings publication (e.g., as a book, report, or issue of a journal). For conference papers that have not been published in a  proceedings, use `Presentation`. |
| Dictionary Entry     | An entry published as part of a dictionary.                  |
| Document             | A generic document  item. This item type has a poor selection of fields and poor support in  citation styles, so it should generally be avoided. |
| Email                | A message sent via email. This type could also be used for other forms of personal communication. |
| Encyclopedia Article | An article or chapter published as part of an encyclopedia.  |
| Film                 | A film or motion  picture. Generally, use this type for artistically-oriented films  (including fictional, non-fictional, and documentary films). For other  types of video items, use `Video Recording`. |

| Hearing              | A formal hearing or meeting report by a legislative body.    |

| Journal Article      | An article published in a scholarly journal (either print or online). |

| Magazine Article     | An article published in a non-scholarly, popular, or trade magazine (either print or online). |
| Manuscript           | An unpublished  manuscript. Use this type for both historical documents and modern  unpublished work (e.g., unpublished manuscripts, manuscripts submitted  for publication, working papers that are not widely available). Can also be used for other forms of historical or archival documents. This item  type can also be adapted to fit many types of unusual items. |
| Map                  | A map. Also use this type for geographic models.             |
| Newspaper Article    | An article published in a newspaper (either print or online). |
| Patent               | A patent awarded for an invention.                           |
| Podcast              | A [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) (an episode of an audio or video program distributed online, often via subscription). |
| Presentation         | A presentation  made as part of a conference, meeting, symposium, lecture, etc. This  item type refers to the presentation itself, not a written version  published as part of a conference proceedings (use `Conference Paper` for such published versions). |
| Radio Broadcast      | An audio  broadcast, such as a radio news show, an episode of a radio  entertainment series, or similar. Includes broadcasts from online radio  stations and audio broadcasts archived online (cf. `Podcast`). |

| TV Broadcast         | An episode of a television series.                           |
| Video Recording      | A video  recording. Use this type for general video items that do not fit into  one of the more specific video item types (e.g., Film, TV Broadcast),  such as YouTube videos or video-based scientific figures. |
| Webpage              | An online page of a  website. When possible, use one of the more specific item types above  (e.g., Magazine Article, Blog Post, Report). |
|                      |                                                              |
| Attachment           | A standalone  attachment file (e.g., a PDF, JPEG, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, or ODT file).  Standalone attachment files have limited functionality in Zotero (e.g.,  they cannot be properly searched or cited). Always [attach files to proper Zotero items](https://www.zotero.org/support/attaching_files#child_versus_standalone_attachment_files). |
| Note                 | A standalone note. Notes can be used for organizing and annotating in Zotero. If you cite a  standalone note, Zotero will use the first 120 characters as the item  title (and will treat the note as an author-less and date-less item).  Citing notes is not a reliable way to add standalone commentary to a  bibliography or reference list. |

For additional legal and historical item types, see [Legal Citations](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/legal_citations).

## Item Fields

Fields included for various item types in Zotero are described below.  Fields are organized into categories based on the kinds of items they  are most typically associated with. Some fields (e.g., Volume, Series)  may also be present for other types of items. Specific meanings of  fields for particular item types are noted where necessary.

Fields marked with an asterisk (*) cannot be used in citations

### General Fields

The following fields exist across multiple item types and have the same purpose for all (or nearly all) types.

| Field       | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Item Type   | The broad type of  item. Item types are generally determined based on how items should be  cited. See descriptions of Zotero’s item types above. You can store more specific information about the type of item (e.g., a novel versus a  biography book) in the Type, Format, or Extra fields or using [tags](https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags#tags). |
| Creators    | The individuals or  entities creating or associated with a work. An item can have multiple  creators of numerous different kinds. See the list of creator types  below. |
| Title       | The principal title of an item. Should be entered in [sentence case](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/sentence_casing). |
| Abstract    | Short description of the work                                |
| Date        | Date of publication. Use “Accessed” for the date an electronic resource was accessed. |
| Short Title | Short form of the title, often without the subtitle. Used mostly in footnote styles for subsequent citations |
| Language    | The language of publication for an item. We recommend storing these as two letter [ISO language codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) followed by two letter [ISO country codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) (e.g., en-US for American English, or de-DE for German).  The Language field is used to determine whether [English Title Casing rules](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/preventing_title_casing_for_non-english_titles) should be applied when formatting item titles. If the stored item data  is in English (e.g., for translated titles), enter en-US or en-UK, even  if the item content is in another language. |

### Fields for Books and Periodicals

| Field                                              | Description                                                  |

If the volume should be  cited with a volume title, include the title in this field (e.g,. “2:  Organizational Psychology”). |
| Issue                                              | The issue number of a  periodical. Typically, issues start at 1 at the beginning of each  year/volume. If a periodical has only a volume number and no issue  number, leave this field blank. |

### Role Labels for Media Creators

For citations to films, recordings, and broadcasts, Zotero currently has limited to support for labeling producers, scriptwriters, and some  other Creator roles. 

To label directors, leave the main Zotero field blank (or enter the names as Contributor) and enter the director names using `Director` in Extra. See [Citing Fields from Extra](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/item_types_and_fields#citing_fields_from_extra) below. 

All Creator roles (Director, Producer, Scriptwriter, etc.) can also be labelled by entering the names using the default `author` role for the item (*Performer* for Audio Recording, *Podcaster* for Podcast, and *Director* for Film, Radio Broadcast, TV Broadcast, and Video Recording) and  adding the appropriate labels in parentheses after the authors' first  names or last names as appropriate for your citation style—e.g.,  MacNaughton || Ian (Producer) for APA style. Note that the labels will  be rendered verbatim in citations; enter abbreviated terms (e.g.,  “Prod.”) here as needed. 

If the style uses initials for author first/given names, rather than  full names (e.g., APA style), if the label contains multiple words  (e.g., “Executive Producer” or “Writer & Director”), Zotero will  abbreviate the words of the label after the first. To avoid this, type a “Word Joiner” character (Unicode U+2060, printed here between quotes:  “⁠”) on either side of each space in the label.

### Citing Fields from Extra

If a Zotero item type is missing fields that are needed for citations, it is possible to add these fields to the Extra field.

Enter each variable on a separate line at the top of the Extra field in the following format:

```
CSL Variable: Value
```

For example:

```
DOI: 10.1128/AEM.02591-07
Original Date: 1824
PMCID: PMC3531190
```

With the exception of Item Type (CSL `Type`) and Date variables (CSL `Issued`, etc.), variables entered in Extra will not override corresponding values entered in proper Zotero fields.

#### Dates

Dates entered in Extra will override the date entered in Zotero's Date  field. Dates must be entered in ISO format (year-month-day). Date ranges can be entered in this format:

```
Issued: 2001-12-15/2001-12-31
```

#### Names

For Creator variables, separate two-field names entered in Extra with two vertical bar characters ('||'), like this:

```
Editorial Director: De Gaulle || Charles
```
