Physical stimulants, such as beverages, masticatories, and tobaccos, constitute another group of interests which compete with food expenditures (interpreting food now solely as nutriments). There is evidence that many races of men have considered such desires fundamental to a standard of living. It is impossible to separate these desires from food and other values. Water may have been the most ancient beverage but we must agree with Pliny that man is so skillful in flattering his vices that he has ever found means to render water poisonous and intoxicating. 20
In the first ages of the world, the human race, bound by no oath of temperance, succeeded, by sheer application of their ingenuity, in finding something better, or perhaps worse . . . [and this beverage] acquired the wonderful power of provoking a sort of madness, known by the name of drunkenness. 21
The origin of these stimulating drinks is lost. The earliest writers say that they must have been invented by Bacchus or Osiris or some other god. The origins of tea, coffee, and probably chocolate, none of which are desired primarily for their nutritive values, are also lost.
Among the other stimulants must be listed the masticatories and the tobaccos. Thus, the customs of chewing betel, 22 fermented tea leaves, gums, and the more stimulating leaves such as the poppy and mitragyna speciosa all originated before records were kept. These have all been used widely in certain civilizations and still are today. Some of them have nutritive values and others have only psychological values. The same may be said of opium, gunja (Indian hemp), and tobacco, although some of these are more localized in their use than others. 23 It is not only the Liverpool dockworkers who, although “on the poverty line,” must have their tobacco, whiskey, and other stimulants. It is a world-wide phenomenon of ancient origin. The peasant lad in the interior of Siam may have an unsavory diet and his clothing may be limited to the most simple breech-clout but he invariably has a native cigarette behind his ear. These are wants of man and, no matter how much we moralize about them, they restrain the pressure of food supply upon the total activities of man. This was observed much earlier by T. R. Malthus.

22 Betel is a combination of the ovate leaves of the betel (a pepper plant), the betel nut which comes from the areca cathecu palm, a little shell lime, tobacco, and other ingredients.

In these same peasant or rural societies the ordinary social stimulus to conspicuous expenditure, other than for food, is not so pronounced as it is in societies where communication is more highly developed. The Chinese, if they can afford it, aim to have a “big belly.” In most countries peasant girls who are good cooks are considered especially desirable wives. This social pressure for increased food expenditure or lack of stimuli for other types of expenditure tends to keep down the increase in “other” expenditures.
In addition to these, certain phenomena which explain the rapid increase of food expenditures among residents of cities or urban districts, where peasant conditions do not generally exist, also explain a part of the food behavior in rural districts. This is partly due to the nutrition characteristics of man which allow great variations in consumption. The actual ingestion of food measured by calorie units has great possibilities for variation between the amounts which ensure survival for adults and the amounts which they will eat when the opportunity affords. Furthermore, the expense quality of the actual foods eaten shows a marked variation between that of persons near actual subsistence and the foods which they eat when their income is larger. Finally, the services furnished with food, forming a part of the food expense, have great possibilities for change. The combination of these three possibilities of variations gives a joint elasticity to the food budget among rural and lower urban levels of consumption which often causes food consumption, as measured by expense, to increase faster than the proportion they originally bore of the consumption dollar at lower income levels. After a certain level is reached, food consumption results in increasing food expenditure but the rate is so slow that the proportion diminishes. This is where “Engelism” begins—and probably ends. Above these groups are the wealthy classes whose habits of expenditure are practically unknown. All that can be claimed concerning the wealthy, from data now on hand, is that “Engelism” probably does not operate among them. The proportion spent for food has no particularly significant relation to their standard of living.
In addition, we must recognize that man is a human being who desires complexes of things rather than single items. At the lowest scale of human living, he must have and “wants” something of every basic need similar to the range satisfied by the most conspicuous material standard of living. The individual at the very lowest plane of living must secure the elements of shelter, clothing, appearance, etc., as well as food. All these requirements are part of the social conventions (standard of living) of the particular civilization in which he lives. Since food is a relatively elastic item of consumption, probably more so than other items in the lowest scale of living, some of its quantity and quality are often sacrificed to satisfy these other needs. In New York it was the rent paid for shelter which took immediate precedence after the first food desires were satisfied, according to R. C. Chapin. In Copenhagen both rent and taxes took precedence after food according to Povl Heiberg. In Buffalo it was shelter and clothing. In Liverpool it was fuel, light and shelter. In India and China it seems to be either shelter or clothing, or both, depending upon the climate and whether the particular class has a permanent abode. Among the unmarried workers (the ricksha men of the Orient and others), it is clothing if they belong to the class without permanent shelter, and the social costs of shelter if they sleep in an expensive place like an opium den or have a permanent shelter. Certain groups, both in the east and in the west, find stimulants competing closely with food. In the west it is generally alcohol and in the east it is opium, Indian hemp, gunja or bai kratawn (Mitragyna Speciosa)** leaves. Among F. M. Eden’s early English families and the Le Play families, it was clothing. For the different studies, the competing factor varies among the necessities for existence according to the following principle: Things which can be secured by an expenditure of time and not money or goods do not always compete materially with food expenditures in the lower scales of living; necessities which require an expenditure of money or goods, materially influence food consumption at this level of life.
This principle may be explained as follows: families with limited incomes, particularly those engaged in agriculture and seasonal industries, generally have a surplus of unused time. Furthermore those permanently employed in the lower ranks of industry frequently have spare time either because of a short working day or because of the fact that not all members of the family are employed. Any item which they need or want for living which can be secured by the use of this otherwise “wasted” time does not compete with money expenditures for food. On the contrary such items may add to the food budget without money payment.
