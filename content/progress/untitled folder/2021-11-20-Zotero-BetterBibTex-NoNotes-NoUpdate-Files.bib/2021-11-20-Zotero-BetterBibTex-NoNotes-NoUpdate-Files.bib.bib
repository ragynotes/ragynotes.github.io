Report on the Progress of the Pharmacy
\par
\emph{Some Medicinal Products from the Straits Settlements} \textemdash{} E. M. Holmes says that Biab, which was believed to belong to the genus Nauclea, is now considered by him to be \emph{Mitragyna speciosa}. Prual does not belong to either of the Rubaceous genera, Lasianthus or Urophyllum. Stapf will shortly publish an account of his identification of the species. Ipoh Aker is supposed by Holmes to more nearly approach \emph{Strychnos wakkuchiana}. Poison~root, No. 4281, is the root of \emph{Dianella nemorosa Lass} (Libiacee). Poko~Lulay is nearly allied to \emph{Garcinia merguensis, Wight}. Buah Kumbong~sa Mamgkok, the fruit possesses large boat-shaped follicles (which open~long before the seed is ripe) attached to the seed. The seed differs from~"Bungtalai" in being covered with dense velvety pubescence, and in the~inner surface of the follicle being abundantly furnished, and the external~spargly so, with stellate haus.\textemdash Pharm, Jour. Trans., 1895, 1095.

Export Trade of Veot, Persia \textemdash Of the exports of Yezd the most im-~portant is that of opium. It was more largely grown in this province than~anything else in comparison with their respective values. Various causes~have lately conduced to a decided falhng off in the cultivation of the~poppy Ina good year the total output of Yezd was some 1200 cases,~each case weighing about 130 Ibs. An average output would be about~1000 to 1200 cases. In speaking of the opium of Verd is included not~alone that only grown in the province, but also that produced m Khoras-~san, Tabbas, and even in the Herat district. `The crude stuff is sent to~Yezd, where it is manufactured. During the past year, viz., 1891-2, the~crop has been but a small one. `The prices ruhng in China and London~were low and not remunerative, consequently only about half the usual~amount was sown in the Yezd district, and this more for speculatwe pur-~poses than for anything else. `To still further reduce the output, the crop,~for want of proper spring rams, was a practical failure Hence, the maxi-~mum quantity of opium manufactured in Yezd was somewhat under 500~cases. One hundred and eighty-two pounds of the crnde material in~Yerd makes one case of 130 Ibs. manufactured article. Of Khorassan's},

P. 369. Steveunayse. Korthals, in a dissertation, printed at Bonn in 1839, established 
the genus Mitragyna. In his great work: Kruidkunde in Verhandelingen over de 
Natuurlijke Geschiedenis (1839-42) he substituted the name Mephegyne, giving a 
description of the genus and of the Indian S. parvifolia, As synonym he gives 
Mitragyne, without however quoting the Bonn dissertation. Stepheyyne was adopted 
(as a subgenus of Neuelea) by Miquel in his Flora of Nederlandsch Indie (1856), and 
as a genus in Genera Plantarum and Fl. Brit. Ind. The Index Kewensis however 
prefers Mitrayyna, followed by Haviland and Cooke, Flora of Bombay 1.81. Common 
sense seems to demand the retention of Mtephegyne. Miquel, Bentham and Hooker 
doubtless had good grounds for their decision.

Physical stimulants, such as beverages, masticatories, and tobaccos, constitute another group of interests which compete with food expenditures (interpreting food now solely as nutriments). There is evidence that many races of men have considered such desires fundamental to a standard of living. It is impossible to separate these desires from food and other values. Water may have been the most ancient beverage but we must agree with Pliny that man is so skillful in flattering his vices that he has ever found means to render water poisonous and intoxicating. \textsuperscript{20}
\par
In the first ages of the world, the human race, bound by no oath of temperance, succeeded, by sheer application of their ingenuity, in finding something better, or perhaps worse . . . [and this beverage] acquired the wonderful power of provoking a sort of madness, known by the name of drunkenness. \textsuperscript{21}
\par
The origin of these stimulating drinks is lost. The earliest writers say that they must have been invented by Bacchus or Osiris or some other god. The origins of tea, coffee, and probably chocolate, none of which are desired primarily for their nutritive values, are also lost.
\par
Among the other stimulants must be listed the masticatories and the tobaccos. Thus, the customs of chewing betel, \textsuperscript{22} fermented tea leaves, gums, and the more stimulating leaves such as the poppy and mitragyna speciosa all originated before records were kept. These have all been used widely in certain civilizations and still are today. Some of them have nutritive values and others have only psychological values. The same may be said of opium, gunja (Indian hemp), and tobacco, although some of these are more localized in their use than others. \textsuperscript{23} It is not only the Liverpool dockworkers who, although ``on the poverty line,'' must have their tobacco, whiskey, and other stimulants. It is a world-wide phenomenon of ancient origin. The peasant lad in the interior of Siam may have an unsavory diet and his clothing may be limited to the most simple breech-clout but he invariably has a native cigarette behind his ear. These are wants of man and, no matter how much we moralize about them, they restrain the pressure of food supply upon the total activities of man. This was observed much earlier by T. R. Malthus.

\par
In these same peasant or rural societies the ordinary social stimulus to conspicuous expenditure, other than for food, is not so pronounced as it is in societies where communication is more highly developed. The Chinese, if they can afford it, aim to have a ``big belly.'' In most countries peasant girls who are good cooks are considered especially desirable wives. This social pressure for increased food expenditure or lack of stimuli for other types of expenditure tends to keep down the increase in ``other'' expenditures.
\par
In addition to these, certain phenomena which explain the rapid increase of food expenditures among residents of cities or urban districts, where peasant conditions do not generally exist, also explain a part of the food behavior in rural districts. This is partly due to the nutrition characteristics of man which allow great variations in consumption. The actual ingestion of food measured by calorie units has great possibilities for variation between the amounts which ensure survival for adults and the amounts which they will eat when the opportunity affords. Furthermore, the expense quality of the actual foods eaten shows a marked variation between that of persons near actual subsistence and the foods which they eat when their income is larger. Finally, the services furnished with food, forming a part of the food expense, have great possibilities for change. The combination of these three possibilities of variations gives a joint elasticity to the food budget among rural and lower urban levels of consumption which often causes food consumption, as measured by expense, to increase faster than the proportion they originally bore of the consumption dollar at lower income levels. After a certain level is reached, food consumption results in increasing food expenditure but the rate is so slow that the proportion diminishes. This is where ``Engelism'' begins\textemdash and probably ends. Above these groups are the wealthy classes whose habits of expenditure are practically unknown. All that can be claimed concerning the wealthy, from data now on hand, is that ``Engelism'' probably does not operate among them. The proportion spent for food has no particularly significant relation to their standard of living.
\par
In addition, we must recognize that man is a human being who desires complexes of things rather than single items. At the lowest scale of human living, he must have and ``wants'' something of every basic need similar to the range satisfied by the most conspicuous material standard of living. The individual at the very lowest plane of living must secure the elements of shelter, clothing, appearance, etc., as well as food. All these requirements are part of the social conventions (standard of living) of the particular civilization in which he lives. Since food is a relatively elastic item of consumption, probably more so than other items in the lowest scale of living, some of its quantity and quality are often sacrificed to satisfy these other needs. In New York it was the rent paid for shelter which took immediate precedence after the first food desires were satisfied, according to R. C. Chapin. In Copenhagen both rent and taxes took precedence after food according to Povl Heiberg. In Buffalo it was shelter and clothing. In Liverpool it was fuel, light and shelter. In India and China it seems to be either shelter or clothing, or both, depending upon the climate and whether the particular class has a permanent abode. Among the unmarried workers (the ricksha men of the Orient and others), it is clothing if they belong to the class without permanent shelter, and the social costs of shelter if they sleep in an expensive place like an opium den or have a permanent shelter. Certain groups, both in the east and in the west, find stimulants competing closely with food. In the west it is generally alcohol and in the east it is opium, Indian hemp, gunja or \textbf{bai kratawn (Mitragyna Speciosa)} leaves. Among F. M. Eden's early English families and the Le Play families, it was clothing. For the different studies, the competing factor varies among the necessities for existence according to the following principle: Things which can be secured by an expenditure of time and not money or goods do not always compete materially with food expenditures in the lower scales of living; necessities which require an expenditure of money or goods, materially influence food consumption at this level of life.
\par
This principle may be explained as follows: families with limited incomes, particularly those engaged in agriculture and seasonal industries, generally have a surplus of unused time. Furthermore those permanently employed in the lower ranks of industry frequently have spare time either because of a short working day or because of the fact that not all members of the family are employed. Any item which they need or want for living which can be secured by the use of this otherwise ``wasted'' time does not compete with money expenditures for food. On the contrary such items may add to the food budget without money payment.

\par
One very striking fact about the primary forests of Malaysia is the enormously high specific endemism. While in the main most of the genera characteristic of the Sunda Islands and the Philippines may extend to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, for the most part the individual species of the different geographic areas are distinct. Thus an undisturbed forest in Borneo, the Philippines, Celebes, or New Guinea will be found to be composed very largely of species mostly confined to one or the other of these geographic areas, or even to parts of any one area. There may be a few widely distributed species in certain genera, but only a few, and these usually occur along or near the seashore. This very fact of highly developed local endemism makes a detailed description of the primary forest covering any wide area an exceedingly complicated and difficult task, for one has to consider a vast number of different species. Within each geographic area above mentioned it will be found that approximately 85 per cent of all woody species\textemdash\^trees, shrubs, vines, and palms, and for that matter most of the herbaceous species, including the epiphytic orchids\textemdash\^will be local endemics ; the ferns are in general much more widely distributed. This specific endemism is, of course, one of the reasons why we have to deal with many thousands of different species of trees when we consider even in a most general way the primary forests of any part of the Indo-Malaysian region. The situation can in no way be compared with the simple forests that characterize the north temperate zone, for, as has been indicated elsewhere, in these tropical regions, outside of the mangrove forests, a gregarious tj-pe of forest\textemdash that is, one made up of a single species \textemdash does not exist, except in certain regions as in parts of New Guinea where large tracts of fresh-water swamp forests occur in the great river valleys dominated by such species as the sago palm (Metroxylon), Melaleuca leucadendron of the myrtle family with its pale papery bark, Mitragyna speciosa of the Rubiaceae, and Campnosperma macrophylla of the Anacardiaceae.},

The new edition eliminates information on drugs no longer used and also the section formerly devoted to general testing procedures and reagents. More than 200 pages have been added to cover the rapidly accumulating number of agents that have been introduced since the previous edition. Dosage information has been amplified, general statements on pharmacological classes of drugs have been added, and the section on veterinary drugs enlarged. Part 1 contains monographs on individual drugs included in the United States, British, and International pharmacopeias and the National Formulary; part 2 contains monographs on drugs not included in the foregoing publications and general statements on classes of related drugs from both sections; and part 3 contains monographs concerning veterinary uses and dosage of drugs.},

Mitragyna. \textemdash{} Various species of this genus of Rubiacece have been used as medicines or intoxicants.\\
The following alkaloids have been reported from species of mitragyna: from M. speciosa Korth, and M. diversifolia Hook., mitragynine, mitraspecine, and mitr aver sine; from M. inermis Kuntze and M. stipu- losa Kuntze, mitrinermine. The last species also con- tains mitraphylline .
\par
Mitragynine and mitraphylline have been studied physiologically. Their chief effect is to relax involuntary muscle causing thereby a fall in blood pressure by dilating the arteries and, in large dose, weakening voluntary muscle. Mitragynine also appears to have some stimulant action on the medullary centers and some local anesthetic effect. Neither one of them is very toxic but mitraphylline is the weaker of the two (see Grewal, J. Pharmacol., 1932, 46, 251, and Massion, Arch, internat. pharmacodyn. therap., 1934, 48, 217). The other alkaloids do not appear to have been physiologically studied.

It should be clearly understood that the sign ' = covers a wide range of meanings, but rarely signifies 'is equivalent to' (' = ')\textbullet{} It usually means no more than that the type-species of the generic name preceding it is regarded as being congeneric with the type-species of the generic name following it.
\par
A large number of inter-generic hybrids have been included. Where these represent artificially produced horticultural inter-generic crosses (especially in the Orchidaceae), the authority for the name is merely given as 'Hort.'
\par
A very large number of variant spellings have been Usted, though no attempt has been made at complete coverage. They include many obvious slips and misprints, in addition to deliberate corrections, altera- tions or 'improvements'. In order to save space, only the author of the variant is cited: for example, 'Galactella B. D. Jacks.' [in Ind. Kew.], rather than 'Galactella Rafin. ex B.D.Jacks.' (=Galatella Cass.). Most of these accidental errors are indicated by the word '(sphalm.)' [ = sphalmate\textbackslash{} in parentheses, except in the case of authors such as Rafinesque, Steudel, Walpers, and a few others, whose habitual disregard of spelling and proof-correction is well known.
\par
Where a generic name covers a mixture of species of other genera, for example, 'Leptolepis Boeck. = Blysmus Panz. ex Schult. + Carex L.', such expressions almost always imply 'spp.'or \^propane'' understood, not that the first name embraces the entire content of the latter names.
\par
Families. The family entries are very largely based upon the useful Hsts pubhshed by Bullock in Taxon, 7: 1-35, 158-63, 1958.\^ Every published family name has been reviewed, and where I have felt that there was or might be a case for the recognition of any such previously proposed family, the essential characters have been given. Some new families have also been proposed (see Kezv Bulletin, 18: 249-73, 1965). The aim has been to secure, so far as possible, a greater equivalence (in morphological distinctness, not in size) between family units, and in the gaps separating them; but very much still remains to be done in this respect. The descriptions of all currently accepted families have been revised where necessary, and in many cases, especially in the smaller and less-knowngroups,greatlyexpanded. Briefcharaaersofsubfamiliesare usuallygiven,butonlyoccasionallythoseoftribes. Afewfamiliesthat are widely recognised, but for which there seem to be in faa no very convincing grounds for such recognition (Lobeliaceae, Hippocrateaceae, etc.), have been reduced. Partly on these grounds, but also largely owing to the difficulty of ascertaining the correct assignment of the genera in every case, the three major subdivisions of the Leguminosae have not been recognised at the family level.

Our observations indicate that mixing several psychoactive ma- terials together is a world-wide practice, as is taking such different substances in one or another sequence. In the case of betel, in Thailand it is chewed with \textbf{Mitragyna speciosa}, which according to \textbf{Schultes} (in Efron et al., 1967) has narcotic properties. \textbf{Ford} (also in \textbf{Efron} et al.) calls attention to the similarity between kava and betel in terms of effects\textemdash betel being chewed by people west of kava-drinking regions. Betel chewing can also be social, for sharing the mixture, Ford says, is important in establishing friendships, in courtship, and in marriage. Far less involved with ceremony and etiquette than kava, betel use, nevertheless, isa social as well as an individual activity.

Opium use in Iran dates back to 850 B.c., and by 1955 when it was prohibited, nearly 200 million people were estimated to be using it (mostly by smoking) for pleasure and treatment of various illnesses. There are now thought to be 500,000 opium users and 30,000 heroin users. Cannabis use appears to be minimal but alcohol is widespread despite the Moslem religious prohibition.
\par
Thailand had a 200-year history of opium use prior to its ban- ning in 1959, At present it has some 50,000 illicit narcotic users\textemdash{} mostly Thai but also Chinese and hill-tribes people\textemdash mostly of heroin in the cities (sometimes mixed with barbiturates) by inhalation. Can- nabis, although illegal, is widely used without any apparent problems. Some amphetamine abuse and considerable alcoholism and drunk driving have become recognized in recent years. A plant (Mitragyna speciosa) known as ``\textbf{kratom}''' is also used but the exact pharmacological nature of its psychoactive effects is not yet known. 
\par
Japan has about 50,000 illegal narcotic users, mostly heroin (by injection) and 90 per cent Japanese (ten to fifteen years ago, 50 per cent were Korean and Chinese). Unlike the situation in the other
\par
Asian countries, this use seemed to be a new practice after the Second World War and, after widespread abuse of amphetamines, developed and receded. Barbiturate abuse is recognized as well as continued abuse of amphetamines and of a locally manufactured drug, Spa, which has mixed pharmacological effects. Alcoholism and drunk driv- ing are major problems and are receiving increasing attention.
\par
Opium was available in Ceylon through special shops until 1948 and there are now about 5,000 users, mostly Indian and Chinese. Cannabis use has a long history with about 200,000 users at present. Indigenous medical use includes use for relief of fatigue, improvement of appetite, aphrodisia, and treatment of insomnia. It is also sold as a powder which is smoked in a cigarette. As in India, alcohol use is taken seriously and, in fact, the most detailed alcohol statistics in Asia are kept in Ceylon. They show that alcohol isthe most commonly used and abused mind-altering drug in the form of toddy (fermented palm- tree sap), arrack (distilled toddy), and ``kasippu'' (illegal arrack).
\par
Burma has an estimated 100,000 narcotic users, mostly opium smokers in the Shan and Kachin states but also Chinese and Bur- mese in the cities. Cannabis is extensively used in the form of ganja, mainly by Indians but also by the Burmese. \textbf{Beinsa} (\textbf{Mitragyna specios}a) leaves are chewed or used to make a syrup or powder which is eaten, smoked, or made into a ``tea.'' Alcohol use is wide spread and increasing.

Although the active principle is well established for Mitragyna speciosa, (that is, mitragynine), this plant does not appear to be a true hallucinogen, and perhaps it should not have been included in this discussion.

Written by experts in their specialist fields the series creates a unique service for the active research chemist, supplying regular critical in-depth accounts of progress in particular areas of chemistry. For over 80 years the Royal Society of Chemistry and its predecessor, the Chemical Society, have been publishing reports charting developments in chemistry, which originally took the form of Annual Reports. However, by 1967 the whole spectrum of chemistry could no longer be contained within one volume and the series Specialist Periodical Reports was born. The Annual Reports themselves still existed but were divided into two, and subsequently three, volumes covering Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry. For more general coverage of the highlights in chemistry they remain a 'must'. Since that time the SPR series has altered according to the fluctuating degree of activity in various fields of chemistry. Some titles have remained unchanged, while others have altered their emphasis along with their titles; some have been combined under a new name whereas others have had to be discontinued},

precursor of camptothecin in Camptotheca acuminata (see Table) have been confirmed.** The stereochemical relationship of desacetylipecoside (16-H) and desacetylisoipecoside (1a-H) to the tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids of Alangium lamarckii and Cephaelis ipecacuanha (see Table) has also been clarified,?5\textemdash?'' the transformations taking place without change in the configuration at C-1, again in contrast to an earlier report.2\textregistered{} Subsequent transformation of strictosidine to ajmalicine, vindoline, and catharanthine was also achieved in cell-free extracts prepared from Catharanthus roseus cell suspension cultures,'' C. roseus callus tissues,''? and intact C. roseus plants.**-3\textdegree{} The incorporation of labelled vincoside into ajmalicine, vindoline, and catharanthine was now found to be negligible.?\textdegree -?\textregistered -292-3\textdegree{} Strictosidine and not vincoside was found to be a precursor of the Corynanthe alkaloids of Mitragyna speciosa and Rauwolfia canescens,*! (see Table) which possess both the 3a and 3f configurations. However, tritium was lost from [3-3H]strictosidine during its conversion into the alkaloids which have a 3f-H. New intermediates (cathenamine) between strictosidine and ajmalicine have been discovered, and old ones (geissoschizine) discarded. Scheme 1 summarizes the biosynthetic steps from strictosidine to ajmalicine and its isomers. Hydrolysis of the glucose residue of strictosidine and opening of the hemiacetal ring affords an aldehyde function at C-21 which reacts with N-4 to yield 4,21-dehydro- corynantheine aldehyde (4). This labile intermediate has been detected in C. roseus cell suspension cultures and trapped by sodium borohydride reduction.*? It is then suggested that the C-18 double bond moves into conjugation to afford the iminium species (7).3? The stereochemistry of the C-19 methyl group is then necessarily determined by the closure of the C-17 enol from the f side on to the end of this conjugated system. Cathenamine (8) results from this mode of ring closure and this alkaloid has been isolated from the cell-free enzyme system prepared from C. roseus cell suspension cultures.*5? It has also been found in the plant Guettarda eximia.* In the former system the optimum yield of cathenamine was obtained by incubating tryptamine and secologanin in the absence of NADPH.''''? Subsequent steps involve the reduction (with NADPH) of cathenamine to afford ajmalicine and tetrahydroalstonine. It is considered that the formation of cathenamine from (7) is reversible since the administration of labelled cathenamine to C. roseus (enzyme system) afforded labelled 19-epi-ajmalicine.*\textdegree * However, unambiguous in vitro \_ studies?* confirm the a priori view that the (rare) 19-epi alkaloids cannot arise by direct cyclization of (7) on the `wrong' side, and we must suppose that an addition of water (or its equivalent) to (7) leads first to 20,2 1-didehydroheteroyohimbine (3); which has. been found in G. eximia,\textregistered{$>$} and thence via the currently unknown 24 A.

The leaves of the tree called ``kratom'' in the Thai language (Mitragyna speciosa) grown in Thailand are known for their narcotic-like property in traditional use (Suwanlert, 1975; Jansen and Prast, 1988). Mitragynine is a main component of kratom (Jansen and Prast, 1988). Macko et al. (1972) reported that mitragynine is comparable to codeine as an analgesic and a cough depressant in rats and mice, and does not induce emesis or dyspnea as does codeine at equivalent doses. Interestingly, the results of that study suggested that mitragynine does not act on opioid receptors, despite the opium-like use of kratom. We have also studied the effects of mitragynine on central nervous systems and observed that mitragynine possesses a marked analgesic effect on phenyl-p-benzoquinone (PBQ) writhing behavior and hot-plate test performances in mice (Watanabe et al, 1992), and the mechanism of this analgesic effect remains to be clarified. The elucidation of the peripheral effect of mitragynine in in vitro preparations may help to clarify the analgesic mechanism.

Hirsutine and dihydrocorynantheine were isolated from the dried hooks and stems of Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) in our laboratory (Aimi et al., 1977). Mitragynine was isolated from the extract of leaves of Mitragyna speciosa harvested in Bangkok by column chromatography as described previously (Ponglux et al., 1994). The chemical structures of these test compounds are shown in Figure 1.

Macko et al. (1972) reported that mitragynine had analgesic and cough depressant effects comparable to those of codeine in dogs, and he also reported the absence of antagonism by nalorphine on its analgesic action. We confirmed the antinociceptive action of the crude alkaloid fraction of Mitragyna speciosa extract on some animal responses including PBQ writhing, hot-plate, pressure and formalin test behavior in mice (Figure 5). The crude extract showed a distinct

Three indole alkaloids (hirsutine, dihydrocorynantheine and mitragynine) are closely related in chemical structure, with an indoloquinolizidine skeleton. Hirsutine and dihydrocorynantheine are components of a Chinese traditional medicine known as Uncaria hook, used for hypertension and related symptoms. Mitragynine was isolated from a Thai herbal medicine, Mitragyna speciosa, which has been used as an opium substitute in Thailand. Hirsutine was found to have strong hypotensive effects, exhibiting Ca2+ channel-blocking activity mainly through the inhibition of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx.
