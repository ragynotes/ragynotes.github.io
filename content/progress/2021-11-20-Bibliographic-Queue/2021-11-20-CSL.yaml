    1 online resource; Specialist Periodical Reports provide systematic and
    detailed review coverage of progress in the major areas of chemical
    research. Written by experts in their specialist fields the series creates a
    unique service for the active research chemist, supplying regular critical
    in-depth accounts of progress in particular areas of chemistry. For over 80
    years the Royal Society of Chemistry and its predecessor, the Chemical
    Society, have been publishing reports charting developments in chemistry,
    which originally took the form of Annual Reports. However, by 1967 the whole
    spectrum of chemistry could no longer be contained within one volume and the
    series Specialist Periodical Reports was born. The Annual Reports themselves
    still existed but were divided into two, and subsequently three, volumes
    covering Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry. For more general
    coverage of the highlights in chemistry they remain a 'must'. Since that
    time the SPR series has altered according to the fluctuating degree of
    activity in various fields of chemistry. Some titles have remained
    unchanged, while others have altered their emphasis along with their titles;
    some have been combined under a new name whereas others have had to be
    discontinued
