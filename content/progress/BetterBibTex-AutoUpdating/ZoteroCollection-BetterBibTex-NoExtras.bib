  abstract = {PREFACE. The papers contained in this volume originally appeared, like their predecessors, in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. For the convenience of Botanists, separate copies of each of these papers were printed off as it appeared, and these form a volume dealing with the Gamopetalce as its predecessors dealt respectively with Thalamiflorce, Disciflorce and Calyciflorce. Each page of the volume bears two numbers. The one at the top of the page is that of the volume of the Journal in which the paper originally appeared. This number is not referred to in the Index, but it is the one which ought to be used by any one quoting this work. The numbers at the bottom of the pages \{xvhich run contifiuously) are those used in the index. The dates of the publication of the Parts included in the present volume are as follows : \textemdash{} No. 14, pages 1 to 120, Journ. As.

The new edition eliminates information on drugs no longer used and also the section formerly devoted to general testing procedures and reagents. More than 200 pages have been added to cover the rapidly accumulating number of agents that have been introduced since the previous edition. Dosage information has been amplified, general statements on pharmacological classes of drugs have been added, and the section on veterinary drugs enlarged. Part 1 contains monographs on individual drugs included in the United States, British, and International pharmacopeias and the National Formulary; part 2 contains monographs on drugs not included in the foregoing publications and general statements on classes of related drugs from both sections; and part 3 contains monographs concerning veterinary uses and dosage of drugs.},

  abstract = {1 online resource; Specialist Periodical Reports provide systematic and detailed review coverage of progress in the major areas of chemical research. Written by experts in their specialist fields the series creates a unique service for the active research chemist, supplying regular critical in-depth accounts of progress in particular areas of chemistry. For over 80 years the Royal Society of Chemistry and its predecessor, the Chemical Society, have been publishing reports charting developments in chemistry, which originally took the form of Annual Reports. However, by 1967 the whole spectrum of chemistry could no longer be contained within one volume and the series Specialist Periodical Reports was born. The Annual Reports themselves still existed but were divided into two, and subsequently three, volumes covering Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry. For more general coverage of the highlights in chemistry they remain a 'must'. Since that time the SPR series has altered according to the fluctuating degree of activity in various fields of chemistry. Some titles have remained unchanged, while others have altered their emphasis along with their titles; some have been combined under a new name whereas others have had to be discontinued},

Although much has changed over time, the availability on the Internet, often supported by misleading marketing strategies, has made their use even more likely and risky. This paper will explore the case of Mitragyna speciosa Korth. (kratom), a tropical tree used traditionally to combat fatigue and improve work productivity among farm populations in Southeast Asia, which has recently become popular as novel psychoactive substance in Western countries. Specifically, it (i) reviews the state of the art on kratom pharmacology and identification; (ii) provides a comprehensive overview of kratom use cross-culturally; (iii) explores the subjective experiences of users; (iv) identifies potential risks and side-effects related to its consumption. Finally, it concludes that the use of kratom is not negligible, especially for self-medication, and more clinical, pharmacological, and socioanthropological studies as well as a better international collaboration are needed to tackle this marginally explored phenomenon.},
