P. 369. Steveunayse. Korthals, in a dissertation, printed at Bonn in 1839, established 
the genus Mitragyna. In his great work: Kruidkunde in Verhandelingen over de 
Natuurlijke Geschiedenis (1839-42) he substituted the name Mephegyne, giving a 
description of the genus and of the Indian S. parvifolia, As synonym he gives 
Mitragyne, without however quoting the Bonn dissertation. Stepheyyne was adopted 
(as a subgenus of Neuelea) by Miquel in his Flora of Nederlandsch Indie (1856), and 
as a genus in Genera Plantarum and Fl. Brit. Ind. The Index Kewensis however 
prefers Mitrayyna, followed by Haviland and Cooke, Flora of Bombay 1.81. Common 
sense seems to demand the retention of Mtephegyne. Miquel, Bentham and Hooker 
doubtless had good grounds for their decision.

\section{\textbf{``Biak'': An Opium Substitute}}

\par
By L. Wray
\par
The leaves of an indigenous tree are sometimes used in Malaya as an opium substitute. In the State of Perak its use is said to have declined in recent years, owing to the introduction of cheap opium; but it is still reported to be much in vogue in Patani and other Northern States. This native report was corroborated by Phya Sri Sahabheb, Vice-Minister for the Interior, Siam, who lately visited Perak. He described a tree, the leaves of which were used in place of opium, in the Siamese-Malay States of the northern part of the Malay Peninsula. From his description, I have no doubt, that the tree is \emph{poko biak}. He said it was a much worse form of drug-habit than opium smoking, the effects on its habitual devotees being far more deleterious.
\par
\emph{Poko biak} is a medium-sized tree, with large leaves and balls of greenish-white flowers. It is widely distributed in Perak, and there is a place near Salak, in the Kuala Kangsar district, named after it. It is known as \emph{Keton} in Patani. It occurs in the jungle and is planted in the kampongs, and also has been preserved when the other trees were felled and cleared away. Consequently, it is frequently seen in and around villages. Specimens of the dried and powdered leaves, as prepared for consumption, have been shown in the economic collection

of the Perak State Museum for over twenty years, and botanical specimens of it were collected in the year 1888. Mr. E. M. Holmes, Curator of the Museum of the Pharmaceutical Society, kindly examined and identified them as \emph{Mitragyne speciosa} of Korthals. This was subsequently confirmed by the Botanists of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, to whom I also sent them. The following description of the tree appears in Sir George King's ``Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula:''
\par
``2. Mitragyne Speciosa, Korth., Obs. de Naucl\'ees Indices, p. 19~(name only).\textemdash Young branches usually dark-coloured, compressed. Leaves membranous, oblong-obovate to oblong, shortly and abruptly acuminate or sub-acute, the base broad and rounded or rarely slightly and suddenly contracted; both surfaces glabrous, the lower mnutely reticulate and sometimes puberulous on the 12 to 15 pairs of slightly curved ascending nerves: length 4 to 5.5 inches; breadth 2 to 3.5 inches; petiole thin, .8 to 1.2 inches long; stipules lanceolate, sparsely pubescent. Corolla .3 inch long; tube of calyx wide, ridged, its mouth wbout .075 inch across. Anthers sagittate at the base. Stigma mitriform.
\par
``Haviland, in Journ. Linn. Soc., XXXIII., 69; \emph{Stephegyne speciosa}, Korth., Verh.-Nat. Gesch. Bot., p. 160; S. parvifolia, K. Schum, fl. Kaiser-Wilh, Land., p. 127; \emph{Nauelea speciosa}, Mig., Fl. Ind. Bat., II., 140.
\par
``Pahang: Ridley, 2190. Perak: Wray, 1896, 4280; Scortechini, 616; King's Collector, 1770, 10029, 10459. Distrib., Sumatra ; Forbes, Borneo; Motley, 1169; Korthals, Philippines: Cuming, Motley: Vidal, New Guinea.''
\par
It will be noticed that the geographical range of the species is very wide: embracing the whole Malayan Archipelago and Peninsula.
\par
A reference to the supposed properties of the plant appears in the ``Kew Bulletin,' No. 5 of 1907, p. 199, where it is stated: ``A communication from Mr. D. Hooper drawing attention to an article by Mr. H. N. Ridley in `Journal of the Asiatic Society' for July, 1897, wherein the writer refers to the leaves of \emph{Mitragyne speciosa}, Korth., as being employed in Perak as a remedy for the opium habit.'' It appears, however, that in the July number for that year there is only one article by Mr. Ridley, and that is ``Malay Plant Names,'' and at p. 58 occurs the only mention of the plant, which is as follows:
\par
```Biak' (Perak): Mitragyne Speciosa, Korth. (Rubiaceae).\textemdash -
\par
Leaves used as a substitute for opinm in Perak, according to Mr. Wray.'' [author of this article?]
\par
This is quite another matter; ``remedy'' and ``substitute'' being words of such widely diverse meaning. It only shows, once again, how very necessary it is to look up references.
\par
pg. 55
\par
There are two distinct ways of preparing the drug for use. In the first, the leaves are picked and put out to dry in the sun, until they become crisp, when they are reduced to a powder by rubbing between the hands. The fibrous ribs and veins of the leaves being removed during the process. The resulting powder may then be stored for future use.
\par
The dose was, characteristically described by an old Malay to be, about four-\emph{duit ayam}'s weight of the powder. A \emph{duit ayam} is a small copper coin having on the obverse the figure of a cock. It was issued by the East India Company at several dates at the beginning of the last century. They weigh on an average 34 grains each, so that the dose would be 136 grains, or, say, 2 1/4 drams Apothecary's weight. The powder is mixed with cold water in a cup and the whole drunk; or an infusion is made with hot water and it is taken like tea. It is usual to take it twice a day, before meals.
\par
The second method of preparation is to dry the leaves as before in the sun, then boil them in water so as to form an infusion. This is strained and the clear filtrate is evaporated to a sirupy consistency. This extract can be kept a long time, and is usually stored in the little horn boxes used by opium smokers for keeping prepared opium. It is called \emph{chandu} by the Malays, which is also the name of opium when prepared for smoking. This extract of \emph{biak} is mixed with hot water before taking. The dose is said to be one \emph{hun}, which is equal to 5.83 grains Troy. Sosme people just put it on to the tongue and wash it down with a drink of water.
\par
The extract may also be smoked, somewhat in the same way as prepared opium. The pipe employed for this purpose is made of the bamboo known to the Malays as \emph{buloh minyak} (\emph{Oxytenanthera sinuata}), and is 14 1/2 inches long and 7/8ths inch in diameter. It is closed hy a natural septum at one end, and is open at the other, this is the end which is applied to the mouth in use. Near the closed end a brass tube is inserted, which projects at right angles to the bamboo, and is 1 3/8 inch long, with a bore of 1/4 inch in diameter. There is in the Museum collection an opium pipe of Patani pattern, almost exactly similar to the one described above, only the bowl, if it may be so called, is of tin in place of brass. The extract is prepared for smoking by mixing it intimately with the finely shredded leaves of the \emph{Palas} palm~(\emph{Licuala paludosa}), cut in the same way, and with the same implements, as native-grown tobacco. This mixture, which is a sticky, fibrous, brown mass, is called \emph{madat}.
\par
A lamp on a tall foot completes the outfit. A specimen in the Perak Museum has a wooden base in the form of a conventionalized four-lobed flower, of 5 1/2 inches square and 1 1/2 inch thick. The upper part consists of a piece of bamboo 2 5/8 inches in diameter, cut so that the upper portion forms a shallow cup, closed beneath by a septum.
\par
pg 56
\par
Below this the greater part of the walls of the bamboo have been cut away, leaving only four equidistant cylindrical-shaped pieces, the lower ends of which are mortised into the wooden base, the whole being 9 inches in height, the cup serves to hold the oil container which is a valve of a fluvio-marine shell. The wick is of twisted cotton cloth, kept in place by a metal support. Coconut oil is burned in it.
\par
The method of smoking is as follows: The smoker sits tailorwise on the floor, with the lamp in front of him. He then takes a small piece of the \emph{madat}, rolls it with his fingers into a pellet, the size of the bore of the brass tube, into which he inserts it, then putting his mouth to the other end of the bamboo he brings the \emph{madat} in contact with the flame of the lamp and inhales the smoke of the burning pellet through the pipe. From twenty to thirty pellets are smoked at atime. 
\par
The effects of the drug, whether taken internally or smoked, are said to resemble those of opium, and in large doses it is poisonous, producing stupor. It is also said that users of it suffer from permanent enlargement of the abdomen. This is attributed, by some, to the indolent life which is induced by indulgence in the \emph{biak} habit.
\par
Besides the purposes already mentioned, the leaves of this tree are used medicinally for worms in children. They are made into a poultice and applied externally over the upper portion of the abdomen. It is held that, if applied to the lower portion, the worms are driven upwards and escape by the mouth; but if confined to just beneath the termination of the ribs they are expelled downwards and are passed in the ordinary way. Of their efficacy as a vermifuge, applied in the manner indicated above, I have very grave doubts.
\par
Some time back I sent about 16 pounds' weight of the dried leaves to Mr. E. M. Holmes for examination. He, however, reported that no poisonous alkaloid had been found in it. A further consignment has now been sent, and it is hoped that the active principle will be successfully separated from the drug.},

\emph{Some Medicinal Products from the Straits Settlements} \textemdash{} E. M. Holmes says that Biab, which was believed to belong to the genus Nauclea, is now considered by him to be \emph{Mitragyna speciosa}. Prual does not belong to either of the Rubaceous genera, Lasianthus or Urophyllum. Stapf will shortly publish an account of his identification of the species. Ipoh Aker is supposed by Holmes to more nearly approach \emph{Strychnos wakkuchiana}. Poison~root, No. 4281, is the root of \emph{Dianella nemorosa Lass} (Libiacee). Poko~Lulay is nearly allied to \emph{Garcinia merguensis, Wight}. Buah Kumbong~sa Mamgkok, the fruit possesses large boat-shaped follicles (which open~long before the seed is ripe) attached to the seed. The seed differs from~"Bungtalai" in being covered with dense velvety pubescence, and in the~inner surface of the follicle being abundantly furnished, and the external~spargly so, with stellate haus.\textemdash Pharm, Jour.

Export Trade of Veot, Persia \textemdash Of the exports of Yezd the most im-~portant is that of opium. It was more largely grown in this province than~anything else in comparison with their respective values. Various causes~have lately conduced to a decided falhng off in the cultivation of the~poppy Ina good year the total output of Yezd was some 1200 cases,~each case weighing about 130 Ibs. An average output would be about~1000 to 1200 cases. In speaking of the opium of Verd is included not~alone that only grown in the province, but also that produced m Khoras-~san, Tabbas, and even in the Herat district. `The crude stuff is sent to~Yezd, where it is manufactured. During the past year, viz., 1891-2, the~crop has been but a small one. `The prices ruhng in China and London~were low and not remunerative, consequently only about half the usual~amount was sown in the Yezd district, and this more for speculatwe pur-~poses than for anything else. `To still further reduce the output, the crop,~for want of proper spring rams, was a practical failure Hence, the maxi-~mum quantity of opium manufactured in Yezd was somewhat under 500~cases.

  abstract = {PREFACE. The papers contained in this volume originally appeared, like their predecessors, in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. For the convenience of Botanists, separate copies of each of these papers were printed off as it appeared, and these form a volume dealing with the Gamopetalce as its predecessors dealt respectively with Thalamiflorce, Disciflorce and Calyciflorce.

Combretum Sundaicum, like Mitragyna speciosa, is a plant whose leaves and stalks are believed in the East to possess anti-opium powers, and have been used by the Chinese to cure the habit of opium-eating. It belongs to the Combretaceae, which contains also several closely allied plants. The usual method of using the drug for the cure of morphism is to prepare a concentrated decoction of the drug 2 ozs. to i quart, of which i oz. is administered every 3 hours with gradually decreasing amounts of morphia. Martindale gives the dose of liquid extract (i in i) as i c.c. The only constituent of the drug hitherto isolated is a resinous body, discovered by E. F. Harrison.},

B. P.\textemdash Anti-opium pills.\textemdash In 1907 articles appeared in Indian newspapers describing a plant the leaves of which were used to alleviate the after-effects of opium. The plant, Mitragyna speciosa (N.U. Rubiaceas), was made the subject of investigation, but no definite results were obtained. A chemist who has lived in China informs us that the so-called anti-opium pills as used in that country contained opium as an invariable constituent. The sale of these was forbidden; possibly the opium in these pills may have been replaced by codeine.}

Physical stimulants, such as beverages, masticatories, and tobaccos, constitute another group of interests which compete with food expenditures (interpreting food now solely as nutriments). There is evidence that many races of men have considered such desires fundamental to a standard of living. It is impossible to separate these desires from food and other values. Water may have been the most ancient beverage but we must agree with Pliny that man is so skillful in flattering his vices that he has ever found means to render water poisonous and intoxicating. \textsuperscript{20}
\par
In the first ages of the world, the human race, bound by no oath of temperance, succeeded, by sheer application of their ingenuity, in finding something better, or perhaps worse . . . [and this beverage] acquired the wonderful power of provoking a sort of madness, known by the name of drunkenness. \textsuperscript{21}
\par
The origin of these stimulating drinks is lost. The earliest writers say that they must have been invented by Bacchus or Osiris or some other god. The origins of tea, coffee, and probably chocolate, none of which are desired primarily for their nutritive values, are also lost.
\par
Among the other stimulants must be listed the masticatories and the tobaccos. Thus, the customs of chewing betel, \textsuperscript{22} fermented tea leaves, gums, and the more stimulating leaves such as the poppy and mitragyna speciosa all originated before records were kept. These have all been used widely in certain civilizations and still are today. Some of them have nutritive values and others have only psychological values. The same may be said of opium, gunja (Indian hemp), and tobacco, although some of these are more localized in their use than others. \textsuperscript{23} It is not only the Liverpool dockworkers who, although ``on the poverty line,'' must have their tobacco, whiskey, and other stimulants. It is a world-wide phenomenon of ancient origin. The peasant lad in the interior of Siam may have an unsavory diet and his clothing may be limited to the most simple breech-clout but he invariably has a native cigarette behind his ear. These are wants of man and, no matter how much we moralize about them, they restrain the pressure of food supply upon the total activities of man. This was observed much earlier by T. R. Malthus.

\par
In these same peasant or rural societies the ordinary social stimulus to conspicuous expenditure, other than for food, is not so pronounced as it is in societies where communication is more highly developed. The Chinese, if they can afford it, aim to have a ``big belly.'' In most countries peasant girls who are good cooks are considered especially desirable wives. This social pressure for increased food expenditure or lack of stimuli for other types of expenditure tends to keep down the increase in ``other'' expenditures.
\par
In addition to these, certain phenomena which explain the rapid increase of food expenditures among residents of cities or urban districts, where peasant conditions do not generally exist, also explain a part of the food behavior in rural districts. This is partly due to the nutrition characteristics of man which allow great variations in consumption. The actual ingestion of food measured by calorie units has great possibilities for variation between the amounts which ensure survival for adults and the amounts which they will eat when the opportunity affords. Furthermore, the expense quality of the actual foods eaten shows a marked variation between that of persons near actual subsistence and the foods which they eat when their income is larger. Finally, the services furnished with food, forming a part of the food expense, have great possibilities for change. The combination of these three possibilities of variations gives a joint elasticity to the food budget among rural and lower urban levels of consumption which often causes food consumption, as measured by expense, to increase faster than the proportion they originally bore of the consumption dollar at lower income levels. After a certain level is reached, food consumption results in increasing food expenditure but the rate is so slow that the proportion diminishes. This is where ``Engelism'' begins\textemdash and probably ends. Above these groups are the wealthy classes whose habits of expenditure are practically unknown. All that can be claimed concerning the wealthy, from data now on hand, is that ``Engelism'' probably does not operate among them. The proportion spent for food has no particularly significant relation to their standard of living.
\par
In addition, we must recognize that man is a human being who desires complexes of things rather than single items. At the lowest scale of human living, he must have and ``wants'' something of every basic need similar to the range satisfied by the most conspicuous material standard of living. The individual at the very lowest plane of living must secure the elements of shelter, clothing, appearance, etc., as well as food. All these requirements are part of the social conventions (standard of living) of the particular civilization in which he lives. Since food is a relatively elastic item of consumption, probably more so than other items in the lowest scale of living, some of its quantity and quality are often sacrificed to satisfy these other needs. In New York it was the rent paid for shelter which took immediate precedence after the first food desires were satisfied, according to R. C. Chapin. In Copenhagen both rent and taxes took precedence after food according to Povl Heiberg. In Buffalo it was shelter and clothing. In Liverpool it was fuel, light and shelter. In India and China it seems to be either shelter or clothing, or both, depending upon the climate and whether the particular class has a permanent abode. Among the unmarried workers (the ricksha men of the Orient and others), it is clothing if they belong to the class without permanent shelter, and the social costs of shelter if they sleep in an expensive place like an opium den or have a permanent shelter. Certain groups, both in the east and in the west, find stimulants competing closely with food. In the west it is generally alcohol and in the east it is opium, Indian hemp, gunja or \textbf{bai kratawn (Mitragyna Speciosa)} leaves. Among F. M. Eden's early English families and the Le Play families, it was clothing. For the different studies, the competing factor varies among the necessities for existence according to the following principle: Things which can be secured by an expenditure of time and not money or goods do not always compete materially with food expenditures in the lower scales of living; necessities which require an expenditure of money or goods, materially influence food consumption at this level of life.
\par
This principle may be explained as follows: families with limited incomes, particularly those engaged in agriculture and seasonal industries, generally have a surplus of unused time. Furthermore those permanently employed in the lower ranks of industry frequently have spare time either because of a short working day or because of the fact that not all members of the family are employed. Any item which they need or want for living which can be secured by the use of this otherwise ``wasted'' time does not compete with money expenditures for food. On the contrary such items may add to the food budget without money payment.

The first instances of a kind of pharmacognostic work can be traced back to the time when about 10 years ago the then Government Labora{$\lnot$} tory extended its work also to some indigenous drugs such as gatom- Miiragyna specie set and others. The work was mainly done by chemists, but not systematically. When the late Dr. Tea Labanukrom},

One very striking fact about the primary forests of Malaysia is the enormously high specific endemism. While in the main most of the genera characteristic of the Sunda Islands and the Philippines may extend to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, for the most part the individual species of the different geographic areas are distinct. Thus an undisturbed forest in Borneo, the Philippines, Celebes, or New Guinea will be found to be composed very largely of species mostly confined to one or the other of these geographic areas, or even to parts of any one area. There may be a few widely distributed species in certain genera, but only a few, and these usually occur along or near the seashore. This very fact of highly developed local endemism makes a detailed description of the primary forest covering any wide area an exceedingly complicated and difficult task, for one has to consider a vast number of different species. Within each geographic area above mentioned it will be found that approximately 85 per cent of all woody species\textemdash\^trees, shrubs, vines, and palms, and for that matter most of the herbaceous species, including the epiphytic orchids\textemdash\^will be local endemics ; the ferns are in general much more widely distributed. This specific endemism is, of course, one of the reasons why we have to deal with many thousands of different species of trees when we consider even in a most general way the primary forests of any part of the Indo-Malaysian region. The situation can in no way be compared with the simple forests that characterize the north temperate zone, for, as has been indicated elsewhere, in these tropical regions, outside of the mangrove forests, a gregarious tj-pe of forest\textemdash that is, one made up of a single species \textemdash does not exist, except in certain regions as in parts of New Guinea where large tracts of fresh-water swamp forests occur in the great river valleys dominated by such species as the sago palm (Metroxylon), Melaleuca leucadendron of the myrtle family with its pale papery bark, Mitragyna speciosa of the Rubiaceae, and Campnosperma macrophylla of the Anacardiaceae.},

The new edition eliminates information on drugs no longer used and also the section formerly devoted to general testing procedures and reagents. More than 200 pages have been added to cover the rapidly accumulating number of agents that have been introduced since the previous edition. Dosage information has been amplified, general statements on pharmacological classes of drugs have been added, and the section on veterinary drugs enlarged. Part 1 contains monographs on individual drugs included in the United States, British, and International pharmacopeias and the National Formulary; part 2 contains monographs on drugs not included in the foregoing publications and general statements on classes of related drugs from both sections; and part 3 contains monographs concerning veterinary uses and dosage of drugs.},

Mitragyna. \textemdash{} Various species of this genus of Rubiacece have been used as medicines or intoxicants.\\
The following alkaloids have been reported from species of mitragyna: from M. speciosa Korth, and M. diversifolia Hook., mitragynine, mitraspecine, and mitr aver sine; from M. inermis Kuntze and M. stipu- losa Kuntze, mitrinermine. The last species also con- tains mitraphylline .
\par
Mitragynine and mitraphylline have been studied physiologically. Their chief effect is to relax involuntary muscle causing thereby a fall in blood pressure by dilating the arteries and, in large dose, weakening voluntary muscle. Mitragynine also appears to have some stimulant action on the medullary centers and some local anesthetic effect. Neither one of them is very toxic but mitraphylline is the weaker of the two (see Grewal, J. Pharmacol., 1932, 46, 251, and Massion, Arch, internat. pharmacodyn. therap., 1934, 48, 217). The other alkaloids do not appear to have been physiologically studied.

A very large number of variant spellings have been Usted, though no attempt has been made at complete coverage. They include many obvious slips and misprints, in addition to deliberate corrections, altera- tions or 'improvements'. In order to save space, only the author of the variant is cited: for example, 'Galactella B. D. Jacks.' [in Ind. Kew.], rather than 'Galactella Rafin. ex B.D.Jacks.' (=Galatella Cass.). Most of these accidental errors are indicated by the word '(sphalm.)' [ = sphalmate\textbackslash{} in parentheses, except in the case of authors such as Rafinesque, Steudel, Walpers, and a few others, whose habitual disregard of spelling and proof-correction is well known.
\par
Where a generic name covers a mixture of species of other genera, for example, 'Leptolepis Boeck. = Blysmus Panz. ex Schult. + Carex L.', such expressions almost always imply 'spp.'or \^propane'' understood, not that the first name embraces the entire content of the latter names.
\par
Families. The family entries are very largely based upon the useful Hsts pubhshed by Bullock in Taxon, 7: 1-35, 158-63, 1958.\^ Every published family name has been reviewed, and where I have felt that there was or might be a case for the recognition of any such previously proposed family, the essential characters have been given. Some new families have also been proposed (see Kezv Bulletin, 18: 249-73, 1965). The aim has been to secure, so far as possible, a greater equivalence (in morphological distinctness, not in size) between family units, and in the gaps separating them; but very much still remains to be done in this respect. The descriptions of all currently accepted families have been revised where necessary, and in many cases, especially in the smaller and less-knowngroups,greatlyexpanded. Briefcharaaersofsubfamiliesare usuallygiven,butonlyoccasionallythoseoftribes. Afewfamiliesthat are widely recognised, but for which there seem to be in faa no very convincing grounds for such recognition (Lobeliaceae, Hippocrateaceae, etc.), have been reduced. Partly on these grounds, but also largely owing to the difficulty of ascertaining the correct assignment of the genera in every case, the three major subdivisions of the Leguminosae have not been recognised at the family level.

Our observations indicate that mixing several psychoactive ma- terials together is a world-wide practice, as is taking such different substances in one or another sequence. In the case of betel, in Thailand it is chewed with \textbf{Mitragyna speciosa}, which according to \textbf{Schultes} (in Efron et al., 1967) has narcotic properties. \textbf{Ford} (also in \textbf{Efron} et al.) calls attention to the similarity between kava and betel in terms of effects\textemdash betel being chewed by people west of kava-drinking regions. Betel chewing can also be social, for sharing the mixture, Ford says, is important in establishing friendships, in courtship, and in marriage. Far less involved with ceremony and etiquette than kava, betel use, nevertheless, isa social as well as an individual activity.

Opium use in Iran dates back to 850 B.c., and by 1955 when it was prohibited, nearly 200 million people were estimated to be using it (mostly by smoking) for pleasure and treatment of various illnesses. There are now thought to be 500,000 opium users and 30,000 heroin users. Cannabis use appears to be minimal but alcohol is widespread despite the Moslem religious prohibition.
\par
Thailand had a 200-year history of opium use prior to its ban- ning in 1959, At present it has some 50,000 illicit narcotic users\textemdash{} mostly Thai but also Chinese and hill-tribes people\textemdash mostly of heroin in the cities (sometimes mixed with barbiturates) by inhalation. Can- nabis, although illegal, is widely used without any apparent problems. Some amphetamine abuse and considerable alcoholism and drunk driving have become recognized in recent years. A plant (Mitragyna speciosa) known as ``\textbf{kratom}''' is also used but the exact pharmacological nature of its psychoactive effects is not yet known. 
\par
Japan has about 50,000 illegal narcotic users, mostly heroin (by injection) and 90 per cent Japanese (ten to fifteen years ago, 50 per cent were Korean and Chinese). Unlike the situation in the other
\par
Asian countries, this use seemed to be a new practice after the Second World War and, after widespread abuse of amphetamines, developed and receded. Barbiturate abuse is recognized as well as continued abuse of amphetamines and of a locally manufactured drug, Spa, which has mixed pharmacological effects. Alcoholism and drunk driv- ing are major problems and are receiving increasing attention.
\par
Opium was available in Ceylon through special shops until 1948 and there are now about 5,000 users, mostly Indian and Chinese. Cannabis use has a long history with about 200,000 users at present. Indigenous medical use includes use for relief of fatigue, improvement of appetite, aphrodisia, and treatment of insomnia. It is also sold as a powder which is smoked in a cigarette. As in India, alcohol use is taken seriously and, in fact, the most detailed alcohol statistics in Asia are kept in Ceylon. They show that alcohol isthe most commonly used and abused mind-altering drug in the form of toddy (fermented palm- tree sap), arrack (distilled toddy), and ``kasippu'' (illegal arrack).
\par
Burma has an estimated 100,000 narcotic users, mostly opium smokers in the Shan and Kachin states but also Chinese and Bur- mese in the cities. Cannabis is extensively used in the form of ganja, mainly by Indians but also by the Burmese. \textbf{Beinsa} (\textbf{Mitragyna specios}a) leaves are chewed or used to make a syrup or powder which is eaten, smoked, or made into a ``tea.'' Alcohol use is wide spread and increasing.

For at least 200 years a vision-inducing substance known as channa has been used by the Hottentots. This plant belongs to the genus Mesenbryanthemum; beyond that, remarkably little is known about it. In Southeast Asia the leaves of a plant from the genus Mitragyna are chewed for their narcotic effects. For this purpose, the leaves are often mixed with betel quid. From North Africa and west to India and China, the plant Peganum harmala is used. This plant, like the Banisteriopsis species of South America, contains harmine and harmaline, which can produce remarkable alterations of perception. In Eurasia this plant has had a very long history in folk medicine. In the tropical rain forests of West Africa, the plant Tabernanthe iboga contains the psychoactive drug ibogaine. This substance is said to have an effect quite similar to that of cocaine. In high doses it produces excitement, confusion, drunkenness, and hallucinations.

The African shrub Tabernanthe iboga contains the hallucinogen ibogaine. Apparently this root is used in parts of Africa to improve endurance. Hunters who eat ibogaine can remain quite still for many hours while awaiting the arrival of their prey. Yohimbine is another alkaloid that has an hallucinogenic effect. Another is mitragynine, a chemical derived from the plant, Mitragyna speciosa. This plant is used as an intoxicant by certain tribes in Borneo.},

Written by experts in their specialist fields the series creates a unique service for the active research chemist, supplying regular critical in-depth accounts of progress in particular areas of chemistry. For over 80 years the Royal Society of Chemistry and its predecessor, the Chemical Society, have been publishing reports charting developments in chemistry, which originally took the form of Annual Reports. However, by 1967 the whole spectrum of chemistry could no longer be contained within one volume and the series Specialist Periodical Reports was born. The Annual Reports themselves still existed but were divided into two, and subsequently three, volumes covering Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry. For more general coverage of the highlights in chemistry they remain a 'must'. Since that time the SPR series has altered according to the fluctuating degree of activity in various fields of chemistry. Some titles have remained unchanged, while others have altered their emphasis along with their titles; some have been combined under a new name whereas others have had to be discontinued},

precursor of camptothecin in Camptotheca acuminata (see Table) have been confirmed.** The stereochemical relationship of desacetylipecoside (16-H) and desacetylisoipecoside (1a-H) to the tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids of Alangium lamarckii and Cephaelis ipecacuanha (see Table) has also been clarified,?5\textemdash?'' the transformations taking place without change in the configuration at C-1, again in contrast to an earlier report.2\textregistered{} Subsequent transformation of strictosidine to ajmalicine, vindoline, and catharanthine was also achieved in cell-free extracts prepared from Catharanthus roseus cell suspension cultures,'' C. roseus callus tissues,''? and intact C. roseus plants.**-3\textdegree{} The incorporation of labelled vincoside into ajmalicine, vindoline, and catharanthine was now found to be negligible.?\textdegree -?\textregistered -292-3\textdegree{} Strictosidine and not vincoside was found to be a precursor of the Corynanthe alkaloids of Mitragyna speciosa and Rauwolfia canescens,*! (see Table) which possess both the 3a and 3f configurations. However, tritium was lost from [3-3H]strictosidine during its conversion into the alkaloids which have a 3f-H. New intermediates (cathenamine) between strictosidine and ajmalicine have been discovered, and old ones (geissoschizine) discarded. Scheme 1 summarizes the biosynthetic steps from strictosidine to ajmalicine and its isomers. Hydrolysis of the glucose residue of strictosidine and opening of the hemiacetal ring affords an aldehyde function at C-21 which reacts with N-4 to yield 4,21-dehydro- corynantheine aldehyde (4). This labile intermediate has been detected in C. roseus cell suspension cultures and trapped by sodium borohydride reduction.*? It is then suggested that the C-18 double bond moves into conjugation to afford the iminium species (7).3? The stereochemistry of the C-19 methyl group is then necessarily determined by the closure of the C-17 enol from the f side on to the end of this conjugated system. Cathenamine (8) results from this mode of ring closure and this alkaloid has been isolated from the cell-free enzyme system prepared from C. roseus cell suspension cultures.*5? It has also been found in the plant Guettarda eximia.* In the former system the optimum yield of cathenamine was obtained by incubating tryptamine and secologanin in the absence of NADPH.''''? Subsequent steps involve the reduction (with NADPH) of cathenamine to afford ajmalicine and tetrahydroalstonine. It is considered that the formation of cathenamine from (7) is reversible since the administration of labelled cathenamine to C. roseus (enzyme system) afforded labelled 19-epi-ajmalicine.*\textdegree * However, unambiguous in vitro \_ studies?* confirm the a priori view that the (rare) 19-epi alkaloids cannot arise by direct cyclization of (7) on the `wrong' side, and we must suppose that an addition of water (or its equivalent) to (7) leads first to 20,2 1-didehydroheteroyohimbine (3); which has. been found in G. eximia,\textregistered{$>$} and thence via the currently unknown 24 A.

Opium and its derivatives constitute the main, and perhaps the onl\^, indis{$\lnot$} putably addictive narcotic drugs. Yet, curiously in view of its known hallucino{$\lnot$} genic effects, opium, so far as ethnographic knowledge goes, appears never to have been used ritually (unless pre- and protohistoric peoples are an excep{$\lnot$} tion). Opium appears to have been employed only medicinally as an anodyne and such, and secularly as a euphoriant\textemdash in both instances undoubtedly be{$\lnot$} cause opium is a true narcotic, promoting sleep, which would not lend opium to ritual use, unlike mescaline, psilocybin, and (to a degree) soma, during which intoxications the subject is awake. Thus, in the form of heroin, it con{$\lnot$} stitutes the chief ``hard drug'' of illicit commerce, and chief target of anhedonic Christendom.59 In this connection, an interesting but very little-known drug should be mentioned/1 In Southeast Asia, especially in Bangkok and Singa{$\lnot$} pore, Mitragyna speciosa, a rubiaceous (coffee family) plant is sold as kratom (``leaves'') or mambog (syrupy infusion), either as an opium substitute or with{$\lnot$} drawal agent.60},

6. Rubiaceae. A family of about 500 genera and 6000 species, most of them tropical trees and shrubs. A few members are herbs growing in temperate climates (e.g. species of Galium, such as the bedstraws, goosegrass or cleavers of Britian). The first subfamily is the Cinchonoideae, the carpels of which bear numerous ovules and which includes Oldenlandia (300 spp.), Condaminea (3 spp.), Cinchona (40 spp.), Uncaria (60 spp.), Nauclea (35 spp.), Gardenia (250 spp.) and Mitragyna (12 spp.). The second subfamily, Rubioideae, has only- one ovule in each loculus; it includes the genera Coffea (40 spp.), Ixora (400 spp.), Pavetta (400 spp.), Psychotria (700 spp.), Cephalis-Uragoga (180 spp.), Mitchella (2 spp.), Asperula (200 spp.), Galium (400 spp.) and Rubia (60 spp.). Products include cinchona barks and their alkaloids such as quinine (q.v.), ipecacuanha root (see `Ipecacuanha'), catechu, from Uncaria gambier, and coffee (q.v.), from Coffea arabica and other species. Of the many other alkaloid- containing species may be mentioned mitragyna leaves, from species of Mitragyna, and yohimbe bark, from Pansinystalia yohimbe. Examples of most of the following constituents will be found in the Research references below. Alkaloids are common and of the indole, oxindole, quinoline and purine types; anthraquinones occur in Morinda, Rubia and Galium, and many have long been used as dyes (e.g. madder, from Rubia tinctorum). Anthocyanins occur in Cinchona-, aucubin glycosides (e.g. asperulin), cyclitols (e.g. quinic acid), coumarins, depsides in Coffea; phlobatannins, catechins (e.g. in Uncaria); diterpenoids and triterpenoids and iridoid glycosides in Genipa. Morinda reticulata is interesting, as it accumulates selenium and is very toxic, like the selenium-accumulating Astragalus species of the Leguminosae.

One group of alkaloids known to occur extensively as the natural A-oxides comprises the quinolizidines of the Boraginaceae, Compositae and Papilionaceae; these are alkaloids, including those of Senecio spp., which cause extensive liver damage in animals using plants containing them as fodder. A number of A-oxide alkaloids of the indole series have been isolated from plant materials, and among those of pharmaceutical significance are the simple hallucinogenic indole derivatives of Amanita spp., reserpine, strychnine, and some Mitragyna alkaloids. Fresh Atropa, Datura, Hyoscyamus, Scopolia and Mandragora each contain the two isomeric A-oxides of hyoscyamine.

Mitragyna leaves. The genus Mitragyna (Fam. Rubiaceae) occurs in west and east Africa, India and S.E. Asia. More than 30 different alkaloids have been characterized, and the majority of these are indole or oxindole structures with an open or closed ring E; they exist in various isomeric forms. One alkaloid, mitragynine, isolated from Mitragyna speciosa has analgesic and antitussive properties similar to those of codeine. Shellard and co-workers have published extensively on this genus; for references, see Phytochemistry, 1975, 14, 557; Planta Med., 1974, 26, 104.

\par
Uncaria species. In addition to Uncaria gambir, the source of catechu (q.v.), the genus is notable for its alkaloids, which resemble those of Mitragyna. Uncaria hooks, the dried climbing hooks and stems of U. sinensis have sedative and antispasmodic properties. They are used in Chinese medicine for the relief of headaches and dizziness caused by hypertension and for the treatment of convulsions in children. The drug contains indole alkaloids, e.g. rhyncophylline and indole alkaloid glycosides which exhibit a long-lasting hypotensive effect (Endo, K. et al., Planta Med., 1983, 49, 188).},

Opium, heroin and marijuana are widely used in Thailand, but it is illegal to buy, sell or possess these drugs in any quantity (the exception is opium, possession of which is legal for consumption - but not sale - among hill tribes). A lesser known narcotic, kratom (a leaf of the Mitragyna speciosa tree), is used by workers and students as a stimulant - similar to Yemen's qat. A hundred kratom leaves sell for around 30B, and are sold for 1 to 3B each; the leaf is illegal and said to be addictive.},

Mitragyna speciosa is only used in its native country Thailand, where it is highly illegal. It is often used to replace opium consumption as a cheaper alternative and has a similar effect in that it renders the user very "stoned" and lazy. It is also used to interrupt opium addiction and may be useful in the treatment of heroin addicts. A few leaves

THE ENTHEOGEN REVIEW , POB 19820, SACRAMENTO , CA 95819-0820, USA While surfing the web a few years ago, I came across the description of a plant called Mitragyna speciosa, or kratom. The short discussion mentioned its unusual combination of effects as being both stimulant and depressant simultaneously, and having an indole chemical structure (something commonly found in psychedelics). I asked a friend who lived in the region where the plant was said to grow to check into its availability; after making a half-hearted effort to find this plant, I was told that it was not very common, and I didn't pursue it further. A year or so later I was at an Entheobotany conference in Mexico, where two of the speakers mentioned this plant. Neither speaker knew of anyone who had actually seen it, used it, or had any first-hand experience with this plant. Since I was planning to be in South East Asia the week following the conference, I decided to make more of an effort to find this exotic species of ethnobotanical interest. Upon getting back to the States (having returned from Mexico and prior to leaving for Asia), I called my friend in South East Asia to help me find this plant.

He also said that he was of the belief that JLF did mention that they were not certain that their material was actually Mitragyna speciosa, or they had mentioned this at one point (since we did not see the advertisement for this, we are unable to comment). Our source doubted that JLF was selling true M. speciosa, as he felt that it is both very difficult to come across, and also hard to get out of Thailand, which appears to be the only country that it is really used in traditionally. The M. speciosa that has been recently commercially available from other sources did indeed come from Thailand.

Alas, we can't help you out with any suppliers of dried Mitragyna speciosa. Perhaps our subscribers can? Live plants are currently available from The Basement Shaman (www.basementshaman.com), but one might have to hit the underground market in Thailand in order to score the dried leaves. Perhaps some brave and enterprising botanical company will send a collector there to gather up enough to sell in the USA? Keep in mind that while the plant is totally legal in the USA, it is scheduled in its native Thailand, with severe penalties for possession and sale; no doubt this is the reason that it is not yet widely available in the USA. \textemdash Eds.

I've frequently gotten questions asking where people can purchase Mitragyna speciosa ikratom). In the past, I was only aware of Shaman Australis selling tissue-cultures, and Basement Shaman selling plants. However, the situation is slowly improving. For live plants, we can now add Native Habitat [POB 644023, Vero Beach, FL 32964, (561) 7788361, Lee@NativeHabitat.com, www.nativehabitat.com] into the fray. They have plants for \$45.00, dried leaf for \$40.00 per ounce, and fresh leaves for \$25.00 per ounce. Interestingly, while the plant is traditionally used for its stimulant/opiate-like effects, the Native Habitat web site remarks, "It does nothing for us...can somebody tell me what we are doing wrong?" I have heard from others who have tried the dried leaves of the plant from various sources and gotten only mild or no effects, and I have also heard from one person who used to get effects from a batch of these leaves but they simply stopped working for him at one point, to his dismay. It's hard to say what is going on. New vendors of dried leaves include Pure Land Ethnobotanicals [2701 University Avenue, PMB 463, Madison, WI 53705-3700, info@ethnobotanicals.com, www.ethnobotanicals.com], who offer 10 grams for \$25.00, 25 grams for \$52.00, and 100 grams for \$160.00, and Ethnogarden [POB 27048, Barrie Ont., L4M 6K4, Canada, ethnogarden@sympatico.ca, http://ethnogarden.com] who offer (in Canadian dollars) 28 grams for \$47.00 (about US \$30.00), 56 grams for \$86.00 (about US \$55.00), 112 grams for \$160.00 (about US \$102.00), and 455 grams for \$575.00 (about US \$365.00), and also sell packets of about 100 seeds (of unknown viability) for \$15.00 (about US \$9.50). I've heard that they have plans to stock a full-spectrum alkaloid free-base ofkratom as well. Herbal-Shaman [POB 8892, Wichita, KS 67208, (877) 685-9199, www.herbal-shaman.com] will soon also be stocking dried leaf.

An increasing number of sources have been selling what they claim is dried leaf of Mitragyna speciosa, known by the common name kratom. Much of this material originated from Bruno Phillips, of Ebotashop (4 res. le Clos des Charmes, rue Emile Zola, 5000 La Roche sur Yon, FRANCE, www.ebotashop.org, e\_bota@hotmail.com), who says that it was sourced from Myanmar, Burma. Phillips and an individual who goes by the name of Farmer Hank were approaching numerous retailers of specially ethnobotanicals and persuading them to carry this product. The material is being made into extract in the United States, described by different companies as "kratom acetate," "mitragynine acetate," and "full-spectrum alkaloid free-base of kratom." One of the people to whom Phillips pitched the dried leaf material for resale was Daniel Siebert. Siebert astutely noticed that this leaf does not match the published description for the plant\textemdash the venation pattern on the leaves was not right and the underside of the leaves was entirely covered in trichomes, giving the leaf a hairy appearance. According to the published botanical description for the leaf of this plant, the top is supposed to be glabrous (smooth), and the bottom has no trichomes present on the interneural parts of the lamina (Shellard \& Lees 1965; Siebert 2003). Siebert suggested that it would be a good idea if I notified ER readers of this misidentified leaf material. It has been suggested that there over 100 kilos of this mystery herb may have been distributed by Phillips worldwide at prices ranging from \$200.00 to \$600.00 per kilo (Shaman Australis 2003); if this true, there is a lot of bad material on the market.

Strangely, some people claim that this material is psychoactive in a manner similar to kratom. Others notice no activity at all. It has now been shown that this material is not kratom, both due to its incompatible botany and due to it not containing mitragynine, a target alkaloid unique to Mitragyna speciosa. It would be interesting to know whether or not those who claim that this material has "kratom-\textbackslash ike" effects have ever tried properly identified kratom. One person who has tried both, commented to me that the bogus material "had some sort of effect, though when comparing it to a small stash of kratom from Thailand I found in my freezer, it had none of the pleasant euphoria and mild rapture of attention, just a sort of beside myself disconnected state" (B.K. 2003). A second person familiar with the effects produced from real kratom commented on the bogus material, stating: "We were sent samples a while back and were thoroughly unimpressed and questioned the validity of the sample" (A.C. 2003).

I also examined "kratom acetate" sold by Ethnogarden and leaves sent to me from France by Bruno. These leaves are allegedly from Myanmar (Burma). The "kratom acetate" was supposedly isolated from leaves obtained from the [Burmese] source. Neither of these produced any visible indole spots on the plates when sprayed with Erlich's reagent. And when exposed to UV light, there were no spots corresponding to those in the reference standards. It is very clear that these do not contain mitragynine. This is not particularly surprising since the morphology of the leaves indicates that they are not Mitragyna speciosa.

Those companies that are selling properly identified Mitragyna speciosa plants include Shaman Australis, The Basement Shaman, Theatrum Botanicum, and Native Habitat. This does not necessarily mean that all of these companies are selling plants that are potent or even active\textemdash Native Habitat has previously commented on the inactivity of the plants that they have. It is currently thought that climate may have an affect on the plant's chemistry, and perhaps a change in climate may increase the potency of their plants. At this time I can not recommend purchasing kratom from any business other than those mentioned directly above. In the future I will provide names of any additional companies that are known to be selling driedkratom that tests positive for mitragynine.

So far as I am aware, there has been no definitive study in humans that shows that mitragynine is the primary active chemical in Mitragyna speciosa, although there have been studies with mice which seem to indicate that it might be (Idid et al. 1998). The sole known oral bioassay of 100 mg mitragynine produced no effects (Wogg 2000). In the 1960s, over 22 alkaloids were reported isolated from Mitragyna speciosa Qansen \& Prast 1988). A few of the alkaloids found therein include speciogynine, speciociliatine, paynantheine, mitragynaline, 7-hydroxy mitragynine, corynantheidaline, 3dehydromitragynine, tetrahydromitragynine, mitralactonal, mitrasulgyline, mitralactonine, and 9-methoxymitralactonine\textemdash the last five of these are new as of 1998, and the last two are from young leaves (Shulgin 2003). Clearly more work needs to be done with the plant; the isolation and quantification of chemicals from plants that are known to be potent would be a good first step. Bioassaying each of these compounds individually in amounts that are found in a comparable amount of a "dose" of active leaf would get us a lot closer to understanding what is going on. Hopefully someone with access to some quantity of potent leaf and the means to extract and isolate the compounds therein will employ the "Heffter technique" in the near future.

There has been some small amount of noise (mainly repeated by vendors of kratom or the bogus material) that in Thailand where Mitragyna speciosa grows, and where it is illegal, the government has had a change of heart and is planning to make it legal in order to treat addictions. I have been unable to locate any reliable source of data for this claim. Also I have heard that the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (their version of the FDA) is planning on placing the chemical mitragynine into their "Schedule 4." This schedule would mean that the plant and dried herb are still legal, so long as they are not being consumed or sold for consumption (Shaman Australis 2003). Frankly, it is mind-boggling that a government agency in Australia has set its sights on this chemical, which may not even be psychoactive in humans, which has never been available in pure form to the masses, and hence which can not reasonably be considered a "drug of abuse" in any realistic sense. As well, it has been reported that the Malaysian National Narcotics Agency engaged a botanist last year to conduct a study to determine if kratom should be classified there as a dangerous drug (Yahya 2002).

can make plant identification a fun and artistic science. Many plants have such unique characteristic cellular structures that there is no mistake as to the identification of the plant. An example might be the analogy to the obvious difference between a rose and a tulip or many other plants for that matter, macroscopically. Most of us can make this distinction by gross appearance and/or smell and even if the specimen cut up, you would still be able to distinguish them from one another, to an extent. Similarly, there are obvious microscopic characteristics that make plants distinguishable to the trained eye just like the rose is to most of us with the naked eye. In the pictures accompanying this article you will observe the microscopic and chromatographic differences between the leaves of Salvia divinorum and Mitragyna speciosa. If we look at the macroscopic features of the two leaves side by side, there would be a clear difference. If the leaves were powdered, you could perform a bioassay to distinguish the two or you could look at them chemically.

Some examples of these combined techniques can demonstrate their utility. We recently had the opportunity to analyze, identify and characterize a plant we weren't familiar with, Mitragyna speciosa (kratom). There were no references for it that we were able to get and we only had some TLC procedures used for identification given to us for the analysis. We were given about 14 different samples and only a few of them were considered reliable or authentic. Of the 14, only seven of them were actually the right plant as determined by the pictures that follow. Our first step was to look at the powdered sample for any characteristic cellular structures that could be used for identification.

In Figure 1 and Figure 2 you are looking at the microscopic image of the surface of the leaf from a powdered sample of Mitragyna speciosa. The pointed structures are trichomes or hairs on the leaf midrib. The sample used for these pictures was a reliable sample and therefore can be considered a standard for the identification of future samples.

I recently read a report on the dopaminergic action of pukateine. This caught my attention as I have been able to find very little on the physiological action of the plant or of isolated pukateine. I would have suspected that it acts on opioid receptors, and perhaps it does to some extent. Nevertheless, the effects that I perceive could be dopamine related, especially as this stuff makes me feel good and clearheaded, without producing the opiate-like mental doping that I was hoping for. It just doesn't have a real sedative effect, although it does produce a relaxed state. Also, it is worth noting that I am not a very good person for reporting valuable bioassay data reports on this subject as I consume about 100 grams of poppy seeds on a daily basis. I do this as an opiate maintenance program. The pukatea could possibly be covered up by this, or potentiated, etc. I would be interested in hearing anyone else's reports on this plant. The search for authentic Mitragyna speciosa specimens that are active is hard enough, even if one does get the real stuff. I have consumed the real thing, and I think that perhaps pukatea may have a similar use.

I wanted to share with you the results of my having given Mitragyna speciosa to ten people over the past month. The kratom came from Cielo Ethnobotanicals and is a finely ground powder. This material is considerably less potent than other kratom that has occasionally been on the market; I have found that a dose of 12-15 grams is needed, as opposed to 2 grams of the higher quality material. Because of the larger amount needed, it is only practical to consume it by making a tea out of it, whereas if one uses the higher quality material one can simply chew 2 grams of the leaf and hold it in the mouth as a quid.

My recent obsession with kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) over the last ten weeks or so has revealed to me some interesting properties of the plant, when taken in combination with other entheogens. I discovered that kratom is very effective when used with tobacco. Kratom is also great in combination with a kava kava \{Piper methysticum) extract. My favorite combination is kratom, kava, and Cannabis. This produces the most narcotic and euphoric ten hours I have ever experienced. Strangely, kratom and Cannabis together (without the kava) takes me "nowhere" and seems to be a useless combination. I also found the combination of kratom and opium to be rather uninteresting. It appears as though the worst combinations with kratom are those that add an additional depressant quality without also adding some sort of stimulant into the mix.\vphantom\}

It's late July in Arizona as I write this, and the ambient air temperature is in the mid-80\textdegree{} F range. It is very difficult to root softwood cuttings using the usual methods in this climate. However, I have come across a product I like very much, since it seems to be the only thing that works under these conditions. It is called the GEL Propagator, and it's available from Charley's Greenhouse (www.charleysgreenhouse.com). The six-cell propagator comes with a clear plastic top to maintain moisture and allow light in. The cells are filled with what looks like agar and rooting hormone. To use, you simply punch a hole in the foil covering the cells, and insert a cutting. The translucent cells allow one to observe root formation. This thing simply works. I was even able to get a Mitragyna speciosa cutting to root (although it later died). I am sure that readers of The Entheogen Review would be interested in this item. \textemdash J.E.,AZ

Why it doesn't work can also only be speculative at this point, and could be based on one or more of a number of factors, including: ALKALOID PROFILE: Different individual trees may contain different alkaloid profiles depending on several factors including genetics and environment. SOURCE: Material from Brazil may have fewer alkaloids than material from Mexico, but more analysis needs to be done. PREPARATION: Variation in extraction procedures may affect results. POTENCY: Some material may simply be more potent than other material, with regard to any "mystery alkaloid(s)." For DMT content, Ott has reported a range of 1 \% to 11 \% (although practically speaking, it seems unlikely that the higher end reported is the norm), and any other alkaloids present might also have an equally wide range of concentration. MISIDENTIFICATION: Ott has pointed out that Mimosa tenuiflora "does look like any number of chaparral-type, mesquite-type, Mimosas or Acacias and superficially could be mistaken for Acacia farnesiana" (Ott 2005). In recent years mis-identified "Argyreia nervosa" seed, "Lagochilus inebrians" seed/flower/ herb, and "Mitragyna speciosa" herb/extract have all been offered commercially. [In the case of DR CA, misidentification is unlikely, since the bark was "well-proven" when taken wth a MAOI.] DIFFERENCES IN INDIVIDUAL BIOCHEMISTRY: Some folks may have higher or lower amounts of gastric MAOI in their systems, and this could have some effect on the activity of any "mystery alkaloid(s)." AGE OF MATERIAL: Although the DMT content of M. tenuiflora is reasonably stable when stored for long periods, it is possible that the "mystery alkaloid(s)" degrade faster. It may be that root-bark needs to be fresher in order to be orally active sans MAOI. PLACEBO EFFECT: Although unlikely, it is possible that those people who reported positive results were only having a placebo effect. \textemdash{} David Aardvark

I like the variety of strange extracts that this company offers, many of which I was not familiar with and had to research. Along with a 70\% alkaloidal extract ofPicralima nitida and a 15X extract oi Mitragyna speciosa, they have 5X extracts of all of the following: Buddleia officinalis flower bud, Salvia divinorum, Salvia miltiorrhiza root, Sophora subprostrata root, and Vita, agnus-castus berry powder. And they have unspecified concentration extracts from Corydalisyanhusuo rhizome powder, Laurelia novae-zelandiae, Leonids leonurus resin, and Mitragynajavanica. Dried whole herbs for many of the same plants that they offer extracts of are available, and they also carry dried Lactuca virosa, Mitragyna parvifolia, Mitragyna stipulosa, Tabemaemontana pachysiphon, and Voacanga africana root-bark, plus a very small selection of seeds and live plants. None of their products are sold for consumption.

Mitragyna speciosa: Leaves of this plant, as kratom, are used as an ``opium substi{$\lnot$} tute'' in southeast Asia, and it has been suggested to be entheogenic, in part based on content of indole alkaloids like mitragynine (Emboden 1979; Harrison McKenna 1989; Jansen \& Prast 1988A; Jansen \& Prast 1988B). Whole leaves of kratom are sti{$\lnot$} mulating, while mitragynine is a depressant (Shellard 1989), suggesting the pharm{$\lnot$} acological importance of secondary alkaloids. Further studies are needed to clarify kratom ethnopharmacognosy. Kratom or gra-tom is used as a stimulant and antidi- arrheal in Thai ethnomedicine (Ponglux etal. 1987). Four African species of Mit{$\lnot$} ragyna were devoid of mitragynine, but rich in other alkaloids (Shellard 1983).}

Opium, heroin and marijuana are widely used in Thailand, but it is illegal to buy, sell or possess these drugs in any quantity. (The possession of opium for consumption - but not sale - among hill tribes is legal). A lesser known narcotic, kratom (a leaf of the Mitragyna speciosa tree), is used by- workers and students as a stimulant - similar to Yemen's qat. A hundred kratom leaves sell for around 60B, and are sold for 3B to 5B each. The leaf is illegal and said to be addictive.

The leaves of the tree called ``kratom'' in the Thai language (Mitragyna speciosa) grown in Thailand are known for their narcotic-like property in traditional use (Suwanlert, 1975; Jansen and Prast, 1988). Mitragynine is a main component of kratom (Jansen and Prast, 1988). Macko et al. (1972) reported that mitragynine is comparable to codeine as an analgesic and a cough depressant in rats and mice, and does not induce emesis or dyspnea as does codeine at equivalent doses. Interestingly, the results of that study suggested that mitragynine does not act on opioid receptors, despite the opium-like use of kratom. We have also studied the effects of mitragynine on central nervous systems and observed that mitragynine possesses a marked analgesic effect on phenyl-p-benzoquinone (PBQ) writhing behavior and hot-plate test performances in mice (Watanabe et al, 1992), and the mechanism of this analgesic effect remains to be clarified. The elucidation of the peripheral effect of mitragynine in in vitro preparations may help to clarify the analgesic mechanism.

Hirsutine and dihydrocorynantheine were isolated from the dried hooks and stems of Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) in our laboratory (Aimi et al., 1977). Mitragynine was isolated from the extract of leaves of Mitragyna speciosa harvested in Bangkok by column chromatography as described previously (Ponglux et al., 1994). The chemical structures of these test compounds are shown in Figure 1.

Three indole alkaloids (hirsutine, dihydrocorynantheine and mitragynine) are closely related in chemical structure, with an indoloquinolizidine skeleton. Hirsutine and dihydrocorynantheine are components of a Chinese traditional medicine known as Uncaria hook, used for hypertension and related symptoms. Mitragynine was isolated from a Thai herbal medicine, Mitragyna speciosa, which has been used as an opium substitute in Thailand. Hirsutine was found to have strong hypotensive effects, exhibiting Ca2+ channel-blocking activity mainly through the inhibition of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx.

Opium, heroin, amphetamines, hallucinogens and marijuana are widely used in Thailand, but it is illegal to buy, sell or possess these drugs in any quantity. (The possession of opium for consumption, but not sale, among hill tribes is legal.) A lesser-known narcotic, krathdwm (a leaf of the Mitragyna speciosa tree), is used by workers and students as a stimulant. A hundred krathawm leaves sell for around 200B, and are sold for 5B to 15B each; the leaf is illegal and said to be addictive.

  abstract = {The use of substances to enhance human abilities is a constant and cross-cultural feature in the evolution of humanity. Although much has changed over time, the availability on the Internet, often supported by misleading marketing strategies, has made their use even more likely and risky. This paper will explore the case of Mitragyna speciosa Korth. (kratom), a tropical tree used traditionally to combat fatigue and improve work productivity among farm populations in Southeast Asia, which has recently become popular as novel psychoactive substance in Western countries. Specifically, it (i) reviews the state of the art on kratom pharmacology and identification; (ii) provides a comprehensive overview of kratom use cross-culturally; (iii) explores the subjective experiences of users; (iv) identifies potential risks and side-effects related to its consumption. Finally, it concludes that the use of kratom is not negligible, especially for self-medication, and more clinical, pharmacological, and socioanthropological studies as well as a better international collaboration are needed to tackle this marginally explored phenomenon.},

\textbf{Methods: } A total of 77 subjects (n=58 regular kratom users, and n=19 healthy controls) participated in this cross-sectional study. All the surveys were conducted through face-to-face interview to elicit subject's socio-demographic characteristics and kratom use history. A full-blood test was also administered. Laboratory analysis was conducted using GC-MS to determine mitragynine content in the acquired kratom samples in order to relate mitragynine consumption with possible alterations in the blood parameters of kratom users.
