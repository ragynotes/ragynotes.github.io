Physical stimulants, such as beverages, masticatories, and tobaccos, constitute another group of interests which compete with food expenditures (interpreting food now solely as nutriments). There is evidence that many races of men have considered such desires fundamental to a standard of living. It is impossible to separate these desires from food and other values. Water may have been the most ancient beverage but we must agree with Pliny that man is so skillful in flattering his vices that he has ever found means to render water poisonous and intoxicating. \textsuperscript{20}
\par
In the first ages of the world, the human race, bound by no oath of temperance, succeeded, by sheer application of their ingenuity, in finding something better, or perhaps worse . . . [and this beverage] acquired the wonderful power of provoking a sort of madness, known by the name of drunkenness. \textsuperscript{21}
\par
The origin of these stimulating drinks is lost. The earliest writers say that they must have been invented by Bacchus or Osiris or some other god. The origins of tea, coffee, and probably chocolate, none of which are desired primarily for their nutritive values, are also lost.
\par
Among the other stimulants must be listed the masticatories and the tobaccos. Thus, the customs of chewing betel, \textsuperscript{22} fermented tea leaves, gums, and the more stimulating leaves such as the poppy and mitragyna speciosa all originated before records were kept. These have all been used widely in certain civilizations and still are today. Some of them have nutritive values and others have only psychological values. The same may be said of opium, gunja (Indian hemp), and tobacco, although some of these are more localized in their use than others. \textsuperscript{23} It is not only the Liverpool dockworkers who, although ``on the poverty line,'' must have their tobacco, whiskey, and other stimulants. It is a world-wide phenomenon of ancient origin. The peasant lad in the interior of Siam may have an unsavory diet and his clothing may be limited to the most simple breech-clout but he invariably has a native cigarette behind his ear. These are wants of man and, no matter how much we moralize about them, they restrain the pressure of food supply upon the total activities of man. This was observed much earlier by T. R. Malthus.

In these same peasant or rural societies the ordinary social stimulus to conspicuous expenditure, other than for food, is not so pronounced as it is in societies where communication is more highly developed. The Chinese, if they can afford it, aim to have a ``big belly.'' In most countries peasant girls who are good cooks are considered especially desirable wives. This social pressure for increased food expenditure or lack of stimuli for other types of expenditure tends to keep down the increase in ``other'' expenditures.
\par
In addition to these, certain phenomena which explain the rapid increase of food expenditures among residents of cities or urban districts, where peasant conditions do not generally exist, also explain a part of the food behavior in rural districts. This is partly due to the nutrition characteristics of man which allow great variations in consumption. The actual ingestion of food measured by calorie units has great possibilities for variation between the amounts which ensure survival for adults and the amounts which they will eat when the opportunity affords. Furthermore, the expense quality of the actual foods eaten shows a marked variation between that of persons near actual subsistence and the foods which they eat when their income is larger. Finally, the services furnished with food, forming a part of the food expense, have great possibilities for change. The combination of these three possibilities of variations gives a joint elasticity to the food budget among rural and lower urban levels of consumption which often causes food consumption, as measured by expense, to increase faster than the proportion they originally bore of the consumption dollar at lower income levels. After a certain level is reached, food consumption results in increasing food expenditure but the rate is so slow that the proportion diminishes. This is where ``Engelism'' begins\textemdash and probably ends. Above these groups are the wealthy classes whose habits of expenditure are practically unknown. All that can be claimed concerning the wealthy, from data now on hand, is that ``Engelism'' probably does not operate among them. The proportion spent for food has no particularly significant relation to their standard of living.
\par
In addition, we must recognize that man is a human being who desires complexes of things rather than single items. At the lowest scale of human living, he must have and ``wants'' something of every basic need similar to the range satisfied by the most conspicuous material standard of living. The individual at the very lowest plane of living must secure the elements of shelter, clothing, appearance, etc., as well as food. All these requirements are part of the social conventions (standard of living) of the particular civilization in which he lives. Since food is a relatively elastic item of consumption, probably more so than other items in the lowest scale of living, some of its quantity and quality are often sacrificed to satisfy these other needs. In New York it was the rent paid for shelter which took immediate precedence after the first food desires were satisfied, according to R. C. Chapin. In Copenhagen both rent and taxes took precedence after food according to Povl Heiberg. In Buffalo it was shelter and clothing. In Liverpool it was fuel, light and shelter. In India and China it seems to be either shelter or clothing, or both, depending upon the climate and whether the particular class has a permanent abode. Among the unmarried workers (the ricksha men of the Orient and others), it is clothing if they belong to the class without permanent shelter, and the social costs of shelter if they sleep in an expensive place like an opium den or have a permanent shelter. Certain groups, both in the east and in the west, find stimulants competing closely with food. In the west it is generally alcohol and in the east it is opium, Indian hemp, gunja or \textbf{bai kratawn (Mitragyna Speciosa)} leaves. Among F. M. Eden's early English families and the Le Play families, it was clothing. For the different studies, the competing factor varies among the necessities for existence according to the following principle: Things which can be secured by an expenditure of time and not money or goods do not always compete materially with food expenditures in the lower scales of living; necessities which require an expenditure of money or goods, materially influence food consumption at this level of life.
\par
This principle may be explained as follows: families with limited incomes, particularly those engaged in agriculture and seasonal industries, generally have a surplus of unused time. Furthermore those permanently employed in the lower ranks of industry frequently have spare time either because of a short working day or because of the fact that not all members of the family are employed. Any item which they need or want for living which can be secured by the use of this otherwise ``wasted'' time does not compete with money expenditures for food. On the contrary such items may add to the food budget without money payment.

The new edition eliminates information on drugs no longer used and also the section formerly devoted to general testing procedures and reagents. More than 200 pages have been added to cover the rapidly accumulating number of agents that have been introduced since the previous edition. Dosage information has been amplified, general statements on pharmacological classes of drugs have been added, and the section on veterinary drugs enlarged. Part 1 contains monographs on individual drugs included in the United States, British, and International pharmacopeias and the National Formulary; part 2 contains monographs on drugs not included in the foregoing publications and general statements on classes of related drugs from both sections; and part 3 contains monographs concerning veterinary uses and dosage of drugs.},

Mitragyna. \textemdash{} Various species of this genus of Rubiacece have been used as medicines or intoxicants.\\
The following alkaloids have been reported from species of mitragyna: from M. speciosa Korth, and M. diversifolia Hook., mitragynine, mitraspecine, and mitr aver sine; from M. inermis Kuntze and M. stipu- losa Kuntze, mitrinermine. The last species also con- tains mitraphylline .
\par
Mitragynine and mitraphylline have been studied physiologically. Their chief effect is to relax involuntary muscle causing thereby a fall in blood pressure by dilating the arteries and, in large dose, weakening voluntary muscle. Mitragynine also appears to have some stimulant action on the medullary centers and some local anesthetic effect. Neither one of them is very toxic but mitraphylline is the weaker of the two (see Grewal, J. Pharmacol., 1932, 46, 251, and Massion, Arch, internat. pharmacodyn. therap., 1934, 48, 217). The other alkaloids do not appear to have been physiologically studied.

Our observations indicate that mixing several psychoactive ma- terials together is a world-wide practice, as is taking such different substances in one or another sequence. In the case of betel, in Thailand it is chewed with \textbf{Mitragyna speciosa}, which according to \textbf{Schultes} (in Efron et al., 1967) has narcotic properties. \textbf{Ford} (also in \textbf{Efron} et al.) calls attention to the similarity between kava and betel in terms of effects\textemdash betel being chewed by people west of kava-drinking regions. Betel chewing can also be social, for sharing the mixture, Ford says, is important in establishing friendships, in courtship, and in marriage. Far less involved with ceremony and etiquette than kava, betel use, nevertheless, isa social as well as an individual activity.

Opium use in Iran dates back to 850 B.c., and by 1955 when it was prohibited, nearly 200 million people were estimated to be using it (mostly by smoking) for pleasure and treatment of various illnesses. There are now thought to be 500,000 opium users and 30,000 heroin users. Cannabis use appears to be minimal but alcohol is widespread despite the Moslem religious prohibition.
\par
Thailand had a 200-year history of opium use prior to its ban- ning in 1959, At present it has some 50,000 illicit narcotic users\textemdash{} mostly Thai but also Chinese and hill-tribes people\textemdash mostly of heroin in the cities (sometimes mixed with barbiturates) by inhalation. Can- nabis, although illegal, is widely used without any apparent problems. Some amphetamine abuse and considerable alcoholism and drunk driving have become recognized in recent years. A plant (Mitragyna speciosa) known as ``\textbf{kratom}''' is also used but the exact pharmacological nature of its psychoactive effects is not yet known. 
\par
Japan has about 50,000 illegal narcotic users, mostly heroin (by injection) and 90 per cent Japanese (ten to fifteen years ago, 50 per cent were Korean and Chinese). Unlike the situation in the other
\par
Asian countries, this use seemed to be a new practice after the Second World War and, after widespread abuse of amphetamines, developed and receded. Barbiturate abuse is recognized as well as continued abuse of amphetamines and of a locally manufactured drug, Spa, which has mixed pharmacological effects. Alcoholism and drunk driv- ing are major problems and are receiving increasing attention.
\par
Opium was available in Ceylon through special shops until 1948 and there are now about 5,000 users, mostly Indian and Chinese. Cannabis use has a long history with about 200,000 users at present. Indigenous medical use includes use for relief of fatigue, improvement of appetite, aphrodisia, and treatment of insomnia. It is also sold as a powder which is smoked in a cigarette. As in India, alcohol use is taken seriously and, in fact, the most detailed alcohol statistics in Asia are kept in Ceylon. They show that alcohol isthe most commonly used and abused mind-altering drug in the form of toddy (fermented palm- tree sap), arrack (distilled toddy), and ``kasippu'' (illegal arrack).
\par
Burma has an estimated 100,000 narcotic users, mostly opium smokers in the Shan and Kachin states but also Chinese and Bur- mese in the cities. Cannabis is extensively used in the form of ganja, mainly by Indians but also by the Burmese. \textbf{Beinsa} (\textbf{Mitragyna specios}a) leaves are chewed or used to make a syrup or powder which is eaten, smoked, or made into a ``tea.'' Alcohol use is wide spread and increasing.
