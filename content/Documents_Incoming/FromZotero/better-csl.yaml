    PREFACE.

    The papers contained in this volume originally appeared, like their
    predecessors, in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. For the
    convenience of Botanists, separate copies of each of these papers were
    printed off as it appeared, and these form a volume dealing with the
    Gamopetalce as its predecessors dealt respectively with Thalamiflorce,
    Disciflorce and Calyciflorce. Each page of the volume bears two numbers. The
    one at the top of the page is that of the volume of the Journal in which the
    paper originally appeared. This number is not referred to in the Index, but
    it is the one which ought to be used by any one quoting this work. The
    numbers at the bottom of the pages {xvhich run contifiuously) are those used
    in the index.

    The dates of the publication of the Parts included in the present volume are
    as follows : —

    The 25th (1955) edition of this encyclopedic compilation of information on
    drugs from various contributors conforms to the manner of presentation of
    the 24th (1947) and previous editions. The new edition eliminates
    information on drugs no longer used and also the section formerly devoted to
    general testing procedures and reagents. More than 200 pages have been added
    to cover the rapidly accumulating number of agents that have been introduced
    since the previous edition. Dosage information has been amplified, general
    statements on pharmacological classes of drugs have been added, and the
    section on veterinary drugs enlarged. Part 1 contains monographs on
    individual drugs included in the United States, British, and International
    pharmacopeias and the National Formulary; part 2 contains monographs on
    drugs not included in the foregoing publications and general statements on
    classes of related drugs from both sections; and part 3 contains monographs
    concerning veterinary uses and dosage of drugs.

    1 online resource; Specialist Periodical Reports provide systematic and
    detailed review coverage of progress in the major areas of chemical
    research. Written by experts in their specialist fields the series creates a
    unique service for the active research chemist, supplying regular critical
    in-depth accounts of progress in particular areas of chemistry. For over 80
    years the Royal Society of Chemistry and its predecessor, the Chemical
    Society, have been publishing reports charting developments in chemistry,
    which originally took the form of Annual Reports. However, by 1967 the whole
    spectrum of chemistry could no longer be contained within one volume and the
    series Specialist Periodical Reports was born. The Annual Reports themselves
    still existed but were divided into two, and subsequently three, volumes
    covering Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry. For more general
    coverage of the highlights in chemistry they remain a 'must'. Since that
    time the SPR series has altered according to the fluctuating degree of
    activity in various fields of chemistry. Some titles have remained
    unchanged, while others have altered their emphasis along with their titles;
    some have been combined under a new name whereas others have had to be
    discontinued

    WASHINGTON — 


    C. McClain Haddow, former chief of staff at the Health and Human Services
    Department, was sentenced Tuesday to a year in prison for pocketing $55,330
    from the government and a private foundation.


    U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell sentenced Haddow on two counts of
    conflict of interest. The judge said that Haddow had breached the public
    trust by following “a course of conduct which involved concealment,
    perpetuation and personal gain.”


    He ordered Haddow to serve the time at a minimum-security prison and said he
    could be released after a third of the term. With credit for good behavior,
    Haddow would spend 90 days in prison, the judge said.


    Gesell also fined Haddow $15,000 and ordered him to make restitution of more
    than $12,000 to the foundation and the government.

    INTRODUCTION  
    This is a transcript of a taped oral history inter-  
    view, one of a series conducted by the Food and  
    Drug Administrations History Office.  The inter-  
    views are with persons, whose recollections may  
    serve to augment the written record.  It is hoped  
    that these narratives of things past will serve  
    as one source along with written and pictorial  
    source materials, for present and future research-  
    ers.  The tapes and transcripts are a part of the  
    collection of the National Library of Medicine.

  abstract: >-
    Kratom (or Ketum) is a psychoactive plant preparation used in Southeast
    Asia. It is derived from the plant Mitragyna speciosa Korth. Kratom as well
    as its main alkaloid, mitragynine, currently spreads around the world. Thus,
    addiction potential and adverse health consequences are becoming an
    important issue for health authorities. Here we reviewed the available
    evidence and identified future research needs. It was found that mitragynine
    and M. speciosa preparations are systematically consumed with rather well
    defined instrumentalization goals, e.g. to enhance tolerance for hard work
    or as a substitute in the self-treatment of opiate addiction. There is also
    evidence from experimental animal models supporting analgesic, muscle
    relaxant, anti-inflammatory as well as strong anorectic effects. In humans,
    regular consumption may escalate, lead to tolerance and may yield aversive
    withdrawal effects. Mitragynine and its derivatives actions in the central
    nervous system involve μ-opioid receptors, neuronal Ca2+ channels and
    descending monoaminergic projections. Altogether, available data currently
    suggest both, a therapeutic as well as an abuse potential.

    Ethnopharmacological relevance

    The genus Mitragyna (Rubiacaeae) has been traditionally used in parts of
    Africa, Asia and Oceania. In recent years, there has been increased interest
    in species of Mitragyna with the introduction of products to western markets
    and regulatory uncertainty.

    Aim of the study

    This paper reviewed the traditional ethnomedicinal uses of leaves for
    species belonging to the genus Mitragyna with reference to the botany and
    known chemistry in order to highlight areas of interest for products
    currently being sold as kratom.

    Materials and methods

    A literature search was conducted using Web of Science, Google Scholar, the
    Royal Museum for Central Africa, Internet Archive, Hathi Trust, and
    Biodiversity Heritage Library search engines in the spring of 2015, fall of
    2016 and winter of 2017 to document uses of bark, leaf and root material.

    Results

    Leaves of M. speciosa (kratom) had the most common documented ethnomedicinal
    uses as an opium substitute or remedy for addiction. Other species of
    Mitragyna were reportedly used for treating pain, however the mode of
    preparation was most often cited as topical application. Other uses of
    Mitragyna included treatment of fever, skin infections, and as a mild
    anxiolytic.

    Conclusions

    Mitragyna species have been used medicinally in various parts of the world
    and that there is significant traditional evidence of use. Modern products
    that include formulations as topical application of liniments, balms or
    tinctures may provide effective alternatives for treatment of certain types
    of pains. Future research is required to establish safety and toxicology
    limits, medicinal chemistry parameters and the potential for different
    physiological responses among varying genetic populations to support
    regulatory requirements for Mitragyna spp.

    Abstract

    ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE:

    The consumption of Mitragyna speciosa (MS) for its psychoactive effects is
    widely reported amongst people in the villages in Thailand and Malaysia even
    though its use is illegal.

    AIM OF THE STUDY:

    This study examined the pattern of MS use, its reported effects and explored
    its potential to cause dependence.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS:

    We used both convenience and snowball-sampling methods to recruit
    participants in a border town between two northern states in Malaysia.
    Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the use of a structured
    questionnaire on 562 respondents who gave oral consent to participate in the
    study.

    RESULTS:

    The response rate was 91%. The majority of the respondents (88%) reported
    daily use of MS. The main mode of using MS was by drinking the MS extract as
    tea (90%). The mean age of starting MS use was 28.3 (SD=8.1) years. A
    variety of reasons were given for using MS including for social and
    recreational needs, stamina and physical endurance, pain relief and improved
    sexual performance. Despite its reported usefulness in weaning off opiate
    addiction, 460 (87%) admitted they were not able to stop using MS. Only
    education level had a statistically significant association with the ability
    to stop or not stop the use of MS (χ(2)=31.0, df=1, p<0.001). Significantly
    higher proportions of those with a lower education level (38%) were able to
    stop using MS compared to respondents with a higher education level.

    CONCLUSIONS:

    Our study provides important information on the pattern of MS use, its
    effects and its potential to cause addiction, as there has been growing
    interest in MS as evidenced by the number of advertisements for its sale on
    the Internet. Future study is required to explore its psychological and
    social impact on users.

  abstract: "WASHINGTON (AP) _ C. McClain Haddow, former chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, was sentenced Tuesday to a year in prison for improperly pocketing $55,330 from the government and a private foundation.   \t   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell, sentencing Haddow on two conflict of interest charges, said Haddow breached the public trust with ''a course of conduct which involved concealment, perpetuation and personal gain.''   \t   The judge ordered that Haddow serve the sentence at a minimum-security prison and be released after serving a third of the term. With credit for good time, Haddow would serve 90 days, the judge said."

    Ethnopharmacological relevance: 

    The genus Mitragyna (Rubiacaeae) has been traditionally used in parts of
    Africa, Asia and Oceania. In recent years, there has been increased interest
    in species of Mitragyna with the introduction of products to western markets
    and regulatory uncertainty.


    Aim of the study:

    This paper reviewed the traditional ethnomedicinal uses of leaves for
    species belonging to the genus Mitragyna with reference to the botany and
    known chemistry in order to highlight areas of interest for products
    currently being sold as kratom.


    Materials and methods:

    A literature search was conducted using Web of Science, Google Scholar, the
    Royal Museum for Central Africa, Internet Archive, Hathi Trust, and
    Biodiversity Heritage Library search engines in the spring of 2015, fall of
    2016 and winter of 2017 to document uses of bark, leaf and root material.


    Results:

    Leaves of M. speciosa (kratom) had the most common documented ethnomedicinal
    uses as an opium substitute or remedy for addiction. Other species of
    Mitragyna were reportedly used for treating pain, however the mode of
    preparation was most often cited as topical application. Other uses of
    Mitragyna included treatment of fever, skin infections, and as a mild
    anxiolytic.


    Conclusions:

    Mitragyna species have been used medicinally in various parts of the world
    and that there is significant traditional evidence of use. Modern products
    that include formulations as topical application of liniments, balms or
    tinctures may provide effective alternatives for treatment of certain types
    of pains. Future research is required to establish safety and toxicology
    limits, medicinal chemistry parameters and the potential for different
    physiological responses among varying genetic populations to support
    regulatory requirements for Mitragyna spp.

    The use of substances to enhance human abilities is a constant and
    cross-cultural feature in the evolution of humanity. Although much has
    changed over time, the availability on the Internet, often supported by
    misleading marketing strategies, has made their use even more likely and
    risky. This paper will explore the case of Mitragyna speciosa Korth.
    (kratom), a tropical tree used traditionally to combat fatigue and improve
    work productivity among farm populations in Southeast Asia, which has
    recently become popular as novel psychoactive substance in Western
    countries. Specifically, it (i) reviews the state of the art on kratom
    pharmacology and identification; (ii) provides a comprehensive overview of
    kratom use cross-culturally; (iii) explores the subjective experiences of
    users; (iv) identifies potential risks and side-effects related to its
    consumption. Finally, it concludes that the use of kratom is not negligible,
    especially for self-medication, and more clinical, pharmacological, and
    socioanthropological studies as well as a better international collaboration
    are needed to tackle this marginally explored phenomenon.

    Background: 

    Kratom is a South Eastern Asian tree whose leaves are used to make tea-like
    brews or swallowed in powdered form for various health and well-being
    reasons including to relieve pain and opioid withdrawal. It is important to
    learn more about the potential public health impact of kratom in the context
    of the opioid epidemic.


    Methods:

    An anonymous online survey of kratom users (2867 current users and 157
    former users) was conducted in September 2017 through the American Kratom
    Association and associated social media sites.


    Results:

    Kratom was used primarily to relieve pain (endorsed by 48% of respondents),
    for anxiety, PTSD, or depression (22%), to increase energy or focus (10%)
    and to help cut down on opioid use and/or relieve withdrawal (10%). Over 90%
    of respondents who used it in place of opioids indicated that it was helpful
    to relieve pain, reduce opioid use, and relieve withdrawal. The reported
    incidence of bad adverse reactions was 13%, and reactions were
    overwhelmingly mild and self-managed.


    Conclusions:

    Respondents reported using kratom for conditions which often require use of
    opioids, including pain and reduction of opioid use. The high self-reported
    efficacy and low incidence of adverse reactions associated with kratom use
    suggest that it may provide a potential alternative to opioids for some
    persons even though it has not been evaluated in multi-center clinical
    trials or approved for any therapeutic purpose. Further study of kratom,
    including systematic characterization of its safety and efficacy for various
    conditions is warranted.

    Mitragyna speciosa (MS), a plant commonly known as kratom, is a widely used
    “legal high” opiate alternative for pain relief. DNA extracted from MS and
    26 additional plant species was amplified by PCR using primers targeting the
    strictosidine beta‐D‐glucosidase (SGD) and secologanin synthase 2 (SLS2)
    genes and detected by high‐resolution melt curves using three intercalating
    dyes. Amplicon sizes were confirmed using agarose gel electrophoresis. The
    observed melt temperatures for SGD and SLS2 were 77.08 ± 0.38°C and 77.61 ±
    0.46°C, respectively, using SYBR® Green I; 80.18 ± 0.27°C and 80.59 ±
    0.08°C, respectively, using Radiant™ Green; and 82.19 ± 0.04°C and 82.62 ±
    0.13°C, respectively, using the LCGreen® PLUS dye. The SLS2 primers
    demonstrated higher specificity and identified MS DNA at 0.05 ng/μL. In a
    duplex reaction, SLS2 and tetrahydrocannabinoic acid synthase gene primers
    detected and differentiated MS and Cannabis sativa (CS) by melt peaks at
    82.63 ± 0.35°C and 85.58 ± 0.23°C, respectively, using LCGreen® PLUS.

  abstract: >-
    Background: Interest in the Southeast Asian natural remedy kratom has
    increased in Western countries recently, along with increasing concern over
    its potential toxic effects.

    Objective: To describe and compare demographics, common co-exposure
    substances, clinical effects, treatments, and medical outcomes of kratom
    “abuse” exposures in the United States (US) and Thailand.

    Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of kratom “abuse” exposures,
    defined as use when attempting to gain a psychotropic effect, reported to
    the National Poison Data System (NPDS) in the US and the Ramathibodi Poison
    Center (RPC) in Thailand from 2010 to 2017. Multivariate analysis identified
    risk factors for severe medical outcomes, defined as both ICU admissions and
    death.

    Results: Nine-hundred-twenty-eight cases were included (760 from NPDS and
    168 from RPC). A greater proportion of cases involved co-exposures in
    Thailand (64.8% versus 37.4%; odds ratio \[OR] = 3.10, 95% confidence
    interval \[CI] = 2.15–4.47, p < .01). Both countries had a similar
    prevalence of opioid and benzodiazepine co-ingestions, but the US had more
    co-ingestions with other sedatives (4.6% versus 0%, OR = 0, 95% CI = 0–0.47,
    p < .01). Common clinical effects included tachycardia (30.4%),
    agitation/irritability (26.2%), and drowsiness/lethargy (21.1%). Six deaths
    occurred, including one single-substance exposure in the US, three
    multiple-substance exposures in the US, and two multiple-substance exposures
    in Thailand. IV fluid administration was provided more frequently in the US
    (OR = 18.82, 95% CI = 5.85–60.56, p < .01).

    Conclusions: Despite lower frequencies of co-ingestants overall, US kratom
    abuse exposures yielded greater clinical severity. This disparity may be
    attributable to differences in the products labeled “kratom,” greater
    sedative co-exposures in the US, and/or differences in population genetics
    or use patterns.

    Two cases of fatalities are reported of which the recreational use of
    Mitragyna speciosa (“kratom”) could be confirmed. One of these cases
    presents with one of the highest postmortem mitragynine concentrations
    published to date. Our results show that even extremely high mitragynine
    blood concentrations following the consumption of kratom do not necessarily
    have to be the direct cause of death in such fatalities as a result of an
    acute overdose. The two cases are compared with regard to the differences in
    mitragynine concentrations detected and the role of mitragynine in the death
    of the subjects. Irrespective of the big differences in mitragynine
    concentrations in the postmortem blood samples, mitragynine was not the
    primary cause of death in either of the two cases reported here.
    Additionally, by rough estimation, a significant difference in ratio of
    mitragynine to its diastereomers in the blood and urine samples between the
    two cases could be seen.

  abstract: "The WHO has announced the eleven substances to be reviewed at the upcoming 43rd Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) meeting, scheduled for 12th-16th October, have been identified through a prioritization process. \_ The ECDD is a scientific advisory body to WHO that is convened at least once a year to make recommendations about the need for and level of international control under the 1971 and 1961 Drug Conventions. Recommendations are based on a thorough scientific review process that assesses psychoactive substances with potential for abuse or dependence. Through this assessment, the ECDD requires scientific evidence, either from literature or other reputable sources, which documents drug-related harms such as abuse, toxicity, and fatalities. Importantly, the recommended scheduling also considers therapeutic use to ensure that international control does hinder access to medicines where they are needed. \_\_ New psychoactive substances to be reviewed for international control at the 43rd ECDD include the opioid isotonitazene; benzodiazepines flubromazolam, clonazolam, diclazepam; the dissociative drugs diphenidine, 2-MeO-diphenidine, and 3-Meo-PCP; the stimulant 3-FPM; the hallucinogenic substance 5-MeO-DALT; and two synthetic cannabinoids, MDMB-4en-PINACA and CUMYL-PEGACLONE. \_Next steps include the critical assessment of these substances using available data from Member State questionnaires and relevant literature. The resulting critical review reports will serve the basis for the Committee’s assessment and will be available for public commentary during a virtual open session held on 12 October. Registration details for the Open Session will be made available on the ECDD website here. \_Scheduling recommendations made by WHO are presented to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), a policy-making body comprising of UN Member States, for acceptance, effectively updating the scheduling status of substances under international control."

    Kratom, a relatively unknown herb among physicians in the western world, is
    advertised on the Internet as an alternative to opioid analgesics, as a
    potential treatment for opioid withdrawal and as a “legal high” with minimal
    addiction potential. This report describes a case of kratom addiction in a
    37-year-old woman with a severe opioid-like withdrawal syndrome that was
    managed successfully with symptom-triggered clonidine therapy and scheduled
    hydroxyzine. A review of other case reports of kratom toxicity, the herb’s
    addiction potential, and the kratom withdrawal syndrome is discussed.
    Physicians in the United States should be aware of the growing availability
    and abuse of kratom and the herb’s potential adverse health effects, with
    particular attention to kratom’s toxicity, addictive potential, and
    associated withdrawal syndrome.

    Background: Kratom, a Southeast Asian plant with opioid-receptor mediated
    eﬀects, has emerged as a potential substance of abuse, with limited data on
    its use and eﬀects. This study characterized kratom user demographics, use
    patterns, and perceived drug eﬀects.

    Methods: A cross-sectional, anonymous online survey was conducted between
    January and December 2017.

    Results: 2,798 kratom users – mean age 40 (SD = 12); predominantly White (90
    %), female (61 %), and located in the US (97 %) – completed the survey.
    Kratom was primarily taken orally in doses of 1−3 g (49 %), with daily use
    (59 %) being most common. Kratom was used for pain (91 %), anxiety (67 %),
    and depression (65 %), with high ratings of eﬀectiveness. 1,144 (41 %) used
    kratom to stop or reduce prescription or illicit opioid use, citing
    decreased opioid withdrawal and craving related to kratom use, with 411
    reporting > 1-year continuous abstinence from opioids attributed to kratom
    use. Roughly one-third of respondents reported adverse eﬀects of kratom,
    largely rated as mild in severity and lasting ≤24 h. Seventeen participants
    (0.6 %) sought treatment for adverse eﬀects. Fifty-six individuals (2 %) met
    DSM-5 criteria for a past-year moderate or severe kratom-related substance
    use disorder (SUD). When asked how troubled they felt regarding their kratom
    use, the mean (SD) rating was 3.2 (9.8) on a scale from 0 to 100.

    Conclusion: Kratom is used among White, middle-aged Americans for symptoms
    of pain, anxiety, depression, and opioid withdrawal. Although regular use
    was typical, kratom-related SUD and serious adverse eﬀects were uncommon.
    Additional research on kratom epidemiology and pharmacology is imperative in
    light of the present opioid epidemic.

    Although some novel psychoactive substances (NPS) are newly discovered
    chemicals, others are traditional or indigenous substances that are
    introduced to new markets. One of these latter substances is a plant many
    people refer to as kratom. Indigenous to Southeast Asia and used for a
    variety of instrumental and recreational purposes, kratom has recently
    become available to Western drug users. Kratom is somewhat unique in that
    the plant contains two different psychoactive chemicals, which have both
    stimulant (mitragynine) and narcotic (7-hydroxymitragynine) properties.
    Thus, kratom may appeal to different types of drug users for reasons other
    than curiosity. In the current study, 15 samples of products that were
    either directly advertised as kratom or were listed in the results of a web
    search (but were not directly advertised as kratom) were purchased for
    testing. After laboratory testing, it was determined that all products
    advertised as kratom contained the active chemical mitragynine, but
    7-hydroxymitragynine was not detected in any of the samples. Implications
    are discussed.

    BACKGROUND: Kratom preparations have raised concerns of public health and
    safety in the US. Investigation into the demographics, perceived beneficial
    and detrimental effects of Kratom as well as common doses and purposes of
    its use are important to properly evaluate its potential health impact.

    METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was conducted in October
    2016 of 10,000 current Kratom users through available social media and
    online resources from the American Kratom Association. A total of 8,049
    respondents completed the survey.

    RESULTS: Kratom is primarily used by a middle-aged (31-50 years),
    middle-income ($35,000 and above) population for purposes of self-treating
    pain (68%) and emotional or mental conditions (66%). Kratom preparations
    present with a dose-dependent effect with negative effects, which were
    primarily gastrointestinal related including nausea and constipation, mainly
    presenting at high (5g or more/dose) and more frequent (22 or more
    doses/week) dosing.

    CONCLUSIONS: Kratom shows a dose-dependent opioid-like effect providing
    self-reported perceived beneficial effects in alleviating pain and relieving
    mood disorders. Kratom was primarily used for self-treatment of pain, mood
    disorders, and withdrawal symptoms associated

    Background: Prescription opioid–related overdose deaths increased sharply
    during 1999–2010 in the United States in parallel with increased opioid
    prescribing. CDC assessed changes in national-level and county-level opioid
    prescribing during 2006–2015.

    Methods: CDC analyzed retail prescription data from QuintilesIMS to assess
    opioid prescribing in the United States from 2006 to 2015, including rates,
    amounts, dosages, and durations prescribed. CDC examined county-level
    prescribing patterns in 2010 and 2015.

    Results: The amount of opioids prescribed in the United States peaked at 782
    morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per capita in 2010 and then decreased
    to 640 MME per capita in 2015. Despite significant decreases, the amount of
    opioids prescribed in 2015 remained approximately three times as high as in
    1999 and varied substantially across the country. County-level factors
    associated with higher amounts of prescribed opioids include a larger
    percentage of nonHispanic whites; a higher prevalence of diabetes and
    arthritis; micropolitan status (i.e., town/city; nonmetro); and higher
    unemployment and Medicaid enrollment.

    Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Despite reductions
    in opioid prescribing in some parts of the country, the amount of opioids
    prescribed remains high relative to 1999 levels and varies substantially at
    the county-level. Given associations between opioid prescribing, opioid use
    disorder, and overdose rates, health care providers should carefully weigh
    the benefits and risks when prescribing opioids outside of end-of-life care,
    follow evidence-based guidelines, such as CDC’s Guideline for Prescribing
    Opioids for Chronic Pain, and consider nonopioid therapy for chronic pain
    treatment. State and local jurisdictions can use these findings combined
    with Prescription Drug Monitoring Program data to identify areas with
    prescribing patterns that place patients at risk for opioid use disorder and
    overdose and to target interventions with prescribers based on opioid
    prescribing guidelines.

  abstract: >-
    Mitragyna speciosa, also known as kratom, has the potential meet the need
    for pain medications that lack the addictiveness and overdose risk of
    classical opioid analgesics, such as morphine. This need is urgent because
    opioid addiction and overdose deaths have risen throughout diverse segments
    of U.S. society. Some opioid addicts have found relief in kratom
    preparations. The use of kratom as an analgesic has been validated by
    historical accounts and contemporary pharmacological research. Although
    kratom is a promising source of analgesic candidates, it is a euphoriant
    with potential for both abuse and addiction. However, kratom appears to be
    less addictive and to have milder withdrawal symptoms than opioid drugs.
    Thus, there is a need to balance the potential medical benefits and abuse of
    M. speciosa.

    Kratom (or Ketum) is a psychoactive plant preparation used in Southeast
    Asia. It is derived from the plant Mitragyna speciosa Korth. Kratom as well
    as its main alkaloid, mitragynine, currently spreads around the world. Thus,
    addiction potential and adverse health consequences are becoming an
    important issue for health authorities. Here we reviewed the available
    evidence and identified future research needs. It was found that mitragynine
    and M. speciosa preparations are systematically consumed with rather well
    defined instrumentalization goals, e.g. to enhance tolerance for hard work
    or as a substitute in the self-treatment of opiate addiction. There is also
    evidence from experimental animal models supporting analgesic, muscle
    relaxant, anti-inflammatory as well as strong anorectic effects. In humans,
    regular consumption may escalate, lead to tolerance and may yield aversive
    withdrawal effects. Mitragynine and its derivatives actions in the central
    nervous system involve μ-opioid receptors, neuronal Ca2+ channels and
    descending monoaminergic projections. Altogether, available data currently
    suggest both, a therapeutic as well as an abuse potential.

  abstract: >-
    A feature of human culture is that we can learn to consume chemical
    compounds, derived from natural plants or synthetic fabrication, for their
    psychoactive effects. These drugs change the mental state and/or the
    behavioral performance of an individual and can be instrumentalized for
    various purposes. After the emergence of a novel psychoactive substance
    (NPS) and a period of experimental consumption, personal and medical
    benefits and harm potential of the NPS can be estimated on evidence base.
    This may lead to a legal classification of the NPS, which may range from
    limited medical use, controlled availability up to a complete ban of the
    drug form publically accepted use. With these measures, however, a drug does
    not disappear, but frequently continues to be used, which eventually allows
    an even better estimate of the drug’s properties. Thus, only in rare cases,
    there is a final verdict that is no more questioned. Instead, the view on a
    drug can change from tolerable to harmful but may also involve the new
    establishment of a desired medical application to a previously harmful drug.
    Here, we provide a summary review on a number of NPS for which the
    neuropharmacological evaluation has made important progress in recent years.
    They include mitragynine (“Kratom”), synthetic cannabinoids (e.g., “Spice”),
    dimethyltryptamine and novel serotonergic hallucinogens, the cathinones
    mephedrone and methylone, ketamine and novel dissociative drugs,
    γ-hydroxybutyrate, γ-butyrolactone, and 1,4-butanediol. This review shows
    not only emerging harm potentials but also some potential medical
    applications.

    RationaleConsideration by the US Drug Enforcement Administration and Food
    and Drug Administration of placing kratom into Schedule I of the Controlled
    Substances Act (CSA) requires its evaluation of abuse potential in the
    context of public health. Objective

    The objective of the study is to provide a review of kratom abuse potential
    and its evaluation according to the 8 factors of the CSA. ResultsKratom
    leaves and extracts have been used for centuries in Southeast Asia and
    elsewhere to manage pain and other disorders and, by mid-twentieth century,
    to manage opioid withdrawal. Kratom has some opioid effects but low
    respiratory depression and abuse potential compared to opioids of abuse.
    This appears due to its non-opioid-derived and resembling molecular
    structure recently referred to as biased agonists. By the early 2000s,
    kratom was increasingly used in the US as a natural remedy to improve mood
    and quality of life and as substitutes for prescription and illicit opioids
    for managing pain and opioid withdrawal by people seeking abstinence from
    opioids. There has been no documented threat to public health that would
    appear to warrant emergency scheduling of the products and placement in
    Schedule I of the CSA carries risks of creating serious public health
    problems. Conclusions

    Although kratom appears to have pharmacological properties that support some
    level of scheduling, if it was an approved drug, placing it into Schedule I,
    thus banning it, risks creating public health problems that do not presently
    exist. Furthermore, appropriate regulation by FDA is vital to ensure
    appropriate and safe use.

  abstract: >-
    During the mid-1990s, Vancouver experienced a well characterized HIV
    outbreak among injection drug users (IDU) and many questioned how this could
    occur in the presence of a high volume needle exchange program (NEP).
    Specific concerns were fuelled by early research demonstrating that frequent
    needle exchange program attendees were more likely to be HIV positive than
    those who attended the NEP less frequently. Since then, some have
    misinterpreted this finding as evidence that NEPs are ineffective or
    potentially harmful. In light of continuing questions about the Vancouver
    HIV epidemic, we review 15 years of peer-reviewed research on Vancouver's
    NEP to describe what has been learned through this work. Our review
    demonstrates that: (1) NEP attendance is not causally associated with HIV
    infection, (2) frequent attendees of Vancouver's NEP have higher risk
    profiles which explain their increased risk of HIV seroconversion, and (3) a
    number of policy concerns, as well as the high prevalence of cocaine
    injecting contributed to the failure of the NEP to prevent the outbreak.
    Additionally, we highlight several improvements to Vancouver's NEP that
    contributed to declines in syringe sharing and HIV incidence. Vancouver's
    experience provides a number of important lessons regarding NEP. Keys to
    success include refocusing the NEP away from an emphasis on public order
    objectives by separating distribution and collection functions, removing
    syringe distribution limits and decentralizing and diversifying NEP
    services. Additionally, our review highlights the importance of context when
    implementing NEPs, as well as ongoing evaluation to identify factors that
    constrain or improve access to sterile syringes.

  abstract: >-
    The leaves of Mitragyna speciosa (commonly known as kratom), a tree
    endogenous to parts of Southeast Asia, have been used traditionally for
    their stimulant, mood-elevating, and analgesic effects and have recently
    attracted significant attention due to increased use in Western cultures as
    an alternative medicine. The plant's active alkaloid constituents,
    mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, have been shown to modulate opioid
    receptors, acting as partial agonists at mu-opioid receptors and competitive
    antagonists at kappa- and delta-opioid receptors. Furthermore, both
    alkaloids are G protein-biased agonists of the mu-opioid receptor and
    therefore, may induce less respiratory depression than classical opioid
    agonists. The Mitragyna alkaloids also appear to exert diverse activities at
    other brain receptors (including adrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic
    receptors), which may explain the complex pharmacological profile of raw
    kratom extracts, although characterization of effects at these other targets
    remains extremely limited. Through allometric scaling, doses of pure
    mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine used in animal studies can be related
    to single doses of raw kratom plant commonly consumed by humans, permitting
    preliminary interpretation of expected behavioral and physiological effects
    in man based on this preclinical data and comparison to both anecdotal human
    experience and multiple epidemiological surveys. Kratom exposure alone has
    not been causally associated with human fatalities to date. However, further
    research is needed to clarify the complex mechanism of action of the
    Mitragyna alkaloids and unlock their full therapeutic potential. This
    article is part of the Special Issue entitled ‘Designer Drugs and Legal
    Highs.’

  abstract: >-
    Mu-opioid receptor agonists represent mainstays of pain management. However,
    the therapeutic use of these agents is associated with serious side effects,
    including potentially lethal respiratory depression. Accordingly, there is a
    longstanding interest in the development of new opioid analgesics with
    improved therapeutic profiles. The alkaloids of the Southeast Asian plant
    Mitragyna speciosa, represented by the prototypical member mitragynine, are
    an unusual class of opioid receptor modulators with distinct pharmacological
    properties. Here we describe the first receptor-level functional
    characterization of mitragynine and related natural alkaloids at the human
    mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors. These results show that mitragynine
    and the oxidized analogue 7-hydroxymitragynine, are partial agonists of the
    human mu-opioid receptor and competitive antagonists at the kappa- and
    delta-opioid receptors. We also show that mitragynine and
    7-hydroxymitragynine are G-protein-biased agonists of the mu-opioid
    receptor, which do not recruit β-arrestin following receptor activation.
    Therefore, the Mitragyna alkaloid scaffold represents a novel framework for
    the development of functionally biased opioid modulators, which may exhibit
    improved therapeutic profiles. Also presented is an enantioselective total
    synthesis of both (−)-mitragynine and its unnatural enantiomer,
    (+)-mitragynine, employing a proline-catalyzed Mannich–Michael reaction
    sequence as the key transformation. Pharmacological evaluation of
    (+)-mitragynine revealed its much weaker opioid activity. Likewise, the
    intermediates and chemical transformations developed in the total synthesis
    allowed the elucidation of previously unexplored structure–activity
    relationships (SAR) within the Mitragyna scaffold. Molecular docking
    studies, in combination with the observed chemical SAR, suggest that
    Mitragyna alkaloids adopt a binding pose at the mu-opioid receptor that is
    distinct from that of classical opioids.

    This paper aimed to summarize kratom’s psychological effects on users and
    the Islamic views on kratom use. A literature survey of published kratom
    studies, teachings based on the holy Qur’an, the Sunnah, and views of
    several Islamic scholars based on qualitative methodology through text
    analysis was conducted. The results demonstrated that despite its beneficial
    therapeutic effects, the harm induced by kratom outweighs its benefits. We
    concluded that kratom use for medicinal purposes is only warranted if useful
    constituent mitragynine can be extracted and used on its own, and if more
    rigorous human studies demonstrated good safety profile and efficacy of
    mitragynine for therapeutic purposes.

  abstract: >-
    Despite the availability of numerous anecdotal reports of polydrug use in
    kratom users, few studies have been carried out in Thailand. This study
    aimed to explore the problem of polydrug use among Thai kratom users. A
    national household survey on the prevalence of substance use was conducted
    in 2011 using a multistage random sampling technique. Participants were
    interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The frequency of other
    substance use was compared between respondents with and without a history of
    kratom use. Of the total sample (18,457), 544 (2.9%) acknowledged kratom
    use. Eighty-nine (46.1%) used it almost every day. The mean age of users
    (SD) was 42.7 (12.8) years old, 459 (84.4%) were male, and 264 (48.5%) had
    used other illicit drugs in the past. Kratom users were significantly more
    likely to use heroin, ecstasy, and ice with adjusted odds ratios of 39.7,
    30.5, and 29.1, respectively. Of 195 who acknowledged kratom use in the past
    12 months, 22 (11.3%) concurrently used other illicit drugs, including
    cannabis, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATSs), and inhalants. Polydrug use is
    common in Thai kratom users who are more likely to use opiates and ATSs in
    their lifetime. Another drug concurrently used was cannabis. Health
    personnel need to be aware of polydrug use in this population.

    INTRODUCTION: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a plant native to Southeast Asia,
    has been used for centuries for its stimulant and opium-like effects.
    Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, exclusive to M. speciosa, are the
    alkaloids primary responsible for Kratom's biologic and psychoactive
    profile, and likely contribute to its problematic use. We purchased several
    commercially available Kratom analogs for analysis and through our results,
    present evidence of probable adulteration with the highly potent and
    addictive plant alkaloid, 7-hydroxymitragynine.

    METHODS: A simple and sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed for
    simultaneous quantification of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in
    methanol extract of marketed Kratom supplements.

    RESULTS: We found multiple commercial Kratom products to have concentrations
    of 7-hydroxymitragynine that are substantially higher than those found in
    raw M. speciosa leaves.

    CONCLUSIONS: We have found multiple packaged commercial Kratom products
    likely to contain artificially elevated concentrations of
    7-hydroxymitragynine, the alkaloid responsible for M. speciosa's concerning
    mechanistic and side effect profile. This study describes a unique form of
    product adulteration, which stresses the importance of increased dietary
    supplement oversight of Kratom-containing supplements.

  abstract: >-
    Addiction of ketum juice among some Muslims in Malaysia has become a hot
    topic for discussion in mass media. The reason is that ketum juice has been
    abused for the wrong purpose such as for getting high or stoned and
    intoxicated. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that ketum juice has its own
    benefits for treating weak bodies as practised by people in the olden days.
    In addition, past society also used ketum leaves as a basic ingredient in
    traditional medicine. For that reason, scholars presently differ in their
    views to determine the legal status of ketum juice. Thus, in order to
    determine the legality of ketum juice, whether halal, haram, mubah or
    makruh, a study was conducted to study the good and bad of ketum juice from
    the scientific perspective. The research methodology used are document and
    content analysis. Research results find that ketum juice has benefits for
    humans. The benefits in using ketum leaves outweigh the disadvantages. Ketum
    leaves can be the alternative treatment for certain diseases followed up by
    doctors’ prescribed medication. The bad of ketum leaves are caused by a
    group of people who mix ketum juice with prohibited substances so as to
    cause getting high or stoned and intoxication. In that regard, scholars are
    of the opinion that it is permitted (mubah) to take ketum juice if it is not
    mixed with prohibited substances and is for treatment and not other
    purposes. If ketum juice is mixed with unclean sources,then its status
    changes from permitted (mubah) to forbidden (haram).

    What is already known about this topic? The prescribed duration of opioid
    analgesics for acute pain in the primary care setting varies by patient and
    condition. What is added by this report? For 10 acute pain conditions
    commonly managed in primary care settings, the probability of obtaining a
    refill after an initial 7-day opioid analgesic prescription ranged from 11%
    (headache) to 41% (musculoskeletal injury), with refill probability <25% for
    most conditions. What are the implications for public health practice?
    Initial opioid analgesic prescriptions of ≤7 days’ duration appear
    sufficient for many patients seen in primary care settings with acute pain.
    Treatment strategies should account for patient- and condition-specific
    characteristics, which might reduce or extend duration of benefit from
    opioid analgesic therapy.

  abstract: >-
    The harm reduction response to drug use has emerged as an evidence-based,
    highly effective and cost-effective component of drug policies around the
    world over the last 30 years. It has been defined by Harm Reduction
    International as “policies, programmes and practices that aim primarily to
    reduce the adverse health, social and economic consequences of the use of
    legal and illegal psychoactive drugs without necessarily reducing drug
    consumption”. In this respect, harm reduction sits alongside, and is
    distinct from, other pillars of drug policy – such as demand reduction and
    supply reduction.

  abstract: "Kratom is a popular ‘legal high’ mainly constituted by alkaloids extracted from the Mitragyna speciosa plant with mitragynine (MG) as the dominant active substance. The increasing use of Kratom for recreational purposes has alerted risk assessment bodies of the lack of information on the real composition and its potential health risks. The present study aimed to determine and compare the MG composition of 13 commercial products of Kratom sold online and in “smartshops”, by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. For the first time, the cytotoxicity induced by pure MG and Kratom, extracts was evaluated in in vitro models of human intestinal (Caco-2) and neuronal (SH-SY5Y) cells after 6 and 24\_h. Genotoxicity was also evaluated in intestinal Caco-2 cells following 24\_h of exposure to subtoxic concentrations using the comet assay. The obtained results revealed an inconsistency between the information (‘power’) provided in labels and the MG content. Cytotoxicity tests revealed a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability in both cellular models, with the SH-SY5Y cells being more sensitive to the Kratom extracts. The resin and the ‘powered extracts’ were the most cytotoxic samples, with IC50 values significantly lower than the leaf extracts and pure MG (P\_<\_0.0001 vs. leaf extracts and MG). In addition, significant DNA damage was observed in Caco-2 cells exposed to these extracts but not to pure MG, which suggests that other substances present in the extracts or interactions involving Kratom components might be responsible for the observed effects."

    Kratom (mitragynine) is a naturally occurring opioid agonist whose use has
    been escalating. Its

    suppliers advertise it as a safe alternative for opioids and a safe
    treatment for opioid-withdrawal

    symptoms. There has been controversy in the past two years regarding the
    legal status and lack of

    regulation surrounding kratom. Currently, kratom is legal and unregulated,
    leaving users at risk from

    unpredictable potencies and effects. We present the first case of successful
    naloxone reversal of

    opioid toxidrome from recreationally used kratom. We advocate further
    research and regulation to

    ensure standardized dosing to protect patients. [Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med.

  abstract: >-
    Mitragynine is the primary active alkaloid in the leaves of the tropical
    tree Mitragyna speciosa, and goes by the popular names "Kratom", biak-biak
    and maeng da. Mitragynine is increasingly seen in forensic toxicology
    casework including driving under the influence of drugs and medicolegal
    death investigation cases. The toxicity of mitragynine continues to be
    debated in the scientific community as advocates highlight its long history
    of use in Southeast Asia and testimonials to its benefits by present-day
    users, while opponents point to an increasing number of adverse events tied
    to mitragynine use in Western societies. Quantitative reports of mitragynine
    in biological specimens from forensic investigations in the literature are
    sparse and may be influenced by poor analyte stability and inadequate
    resolution of mitragynine from its diastereomers, which could lead to
    falsely elevated concentrations and subsequently render those reported
    concentrations inappropriate for comparison to a reference range. Over the
    course of 27 months, 1,001 blood specimens submitted to our laboratory
    tested positive for mitragynine using a sensitive and specific quantitative
    LC-MS/MS method; concentrations ranged from 5.6-29,000 ng/mL, with mean and
    median concentrations of 410 ± 1,124 and 130 ng/mL, respectively.
    Mitragynine presents an analytical challenge that requires a method that
    appropriately separates and identifies mitragynine itself from its isomers
    and other related natural products. We describe a validated analytical
    method and present a short series of case reports that provide examples of
    apparent adverse events, and the associated range of mitragynine
    concentrations. This type of analytical specificity is required to
    appropriately interpret mitragynine concentrations detected in biological
    specimens from forensic casework and assess its potential toxicity.

    Varied pharmacological responses have been reported for mitragynine in the
    literature, but no supportive scientific explanations have been given for
    this. These studies have been undertaken without a sufficient understanding
    of the physicochemical properties of mitragynine. In this work a UV
    spectrophotometer approach and HPLC-UV method were employed to ascertain the
    physicochemical properties of mitragynine. The pKa of mitragynine measured
    by conventional UV (8.11 ± 0.11) was in agreement with the microplate reader
    determination (8.08 ± 0.04). Mitragynine is a lipophilic alkaloid, as
    indicated by a logP value of 1.73. Mitragynine had poor solubility in water
    and basic media, and conversely in acidic environments, but it is acid
    labile. In an in vitro dissolution the total drug release was higher for the
    simulated gastric fluid but was prolonged and incomplete for the simulated
    intestinal fluid. The hydrophobicity, poor water solubility, high
    variability of drug release in simulated biological fluids and acid
    degradable characteristics of mitragynine probably explain the large
    variability of its pharmacological responses reported in the literature. The
    determined physicochemical properties of mitragynine will provide a basis
    for developing a suitable formulation to further improve its solubility,
    stability and oral absorption for better assessment of this compound in
    preclinical studies.

    Kratom is indigenous to Thailand. Market gardeners, peasants and labourers
    often become addicted to kratom leaf use. In certain respects kratom
    addiction resembles addiction to a drug with narcotic properties, except
    that long-term kratom addicts develop a dark skin, particularly on the
    cheeks. The age of onset is apparently later than in heroin addiction, and
    females are rare amongst those who use the substance.

    Objective Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa. Korth) is an indigenous medicinal
    plant of Southeast Asia. This review paper aims to describe the trends of
    kratom use in Southeast Asia. Design A literature review search was
    conducted through ScienceDirect, Scopus, ProMed and Google Scholar.
    Twenty-five articles illustrating kratom use in humans in Southeast Asia
    were reviewed. Results Kratom has long been used by rural populations in
    Southeast Asia as a remedy for common ailments, to fight fatigue from hard
    manual work, as a drink during social interaction among men, and in village
    religious functions. Studies based on self-reports suggest that prolonged
    kratom use does not result in serious health risks or impair social
    functioning. Two recent trends have also emerged: (a) Kratom is reportedly
    being used to ease withdrawal from opioid dependence in rural settings;
    whereas (b) in urban areas, adulterated kratom cocktails are being consumed
    by younger people to induce euphoria. Conclusions Legal sanctions appear to
    have preceded serious scientific investigations into the claimed benefits of
    ketum. More objective-controlled trials and experiments on humans need to be
    conducted to validate self-report claims by kratom users in the community.

    Kratom (
                  Mitragyna speciosa
                  Korth., Rubiaceae) is native to and has traditional use in Southeast Asia. The number of kratom users outside of Southeast Asia has increased significantly in recent decades with use spreading to the Unites States (US) and Europe. Because of its reputed opioid-like psychoactive effects at higher doses, kratom has been regulated in several countries and is subject to an import ban by the US Food and Drug Administration. Nonetheless, in the US it is estimated that 10–15 million people consume kratom primarily for the self-treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, to mitigate withdrawal from or dependence on opioids, and to self-treat opioid use disorder or other substance use disorders (SUDs). Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage in the supply of kratom products may place unexpected burdens on kratom users, potentially influencing some who use kratom for SUD self-treatment to regress to harmful drug use, hence increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes, including overdose. Inadequate treatment, treatment barriers, and increases in the sales of adulterated kratom products on the internet or in convenience stores could exacerbate circumstances further. Although there are currently no verified indications of kratom scarcity, researchers and clinicians should be aware of and remain vigilant to this unanticipated possibility.

    Ethnopharmacological relevance

    Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) from the Rubiaceae family is an
    indigenous tropical medicinal tree of Southeast Asia. Kratom leaves have
    been used for decades in Malaysia and Thailand in traditional context for
    its perceived vast medicinal value, and as a mild stimulant among manual
    labourers. Kratom consumption has been reported to cause side-effects in
    kratom users.

    Aim of the study

    To evaluate kratom's effects towards hematological and clinical-chemistry
    parameters among regular kratom users in Malaysia.

    Methods

    A total of 77 subjects (n=58 regular kratom users, and n=19 healthy
    controls) participated in this cross-sectional study. All the surveys were
    conducted through face-to-face interview to elicit subject's
    socio-demographic characteristics and kratom use history. A full-blood test
    was also administered. Laboratory analysis was conducted using GC-MS to
    determine mitragynine content in the acquired kratom samples in order to
    relate mitragynine consumption with possible alterations in the blood
    parameters of kratom users.

    Results

    Findings showed that there were no significant differences in the
    hematological and clinical-chemistry parameters of traditional kratom users
    and healthy controls, except for HDL and LDL cholesterol values; these were
    found to be above the normal reference range for the former. Similarly,
    long-term kratom consumption (>5 years), and quantity of daily kratom use
    (≥3 ½ glasses; mitragynine content 76.3–114.8mg) did not appear to alter the
    hematological and biochemical parameters of kratom users.

    Conclusion

    These data suggest that even long-term and heavy kratom consumption did not
    significantly alter the hematological and clinical-chemistry parameters of
    kratom users in a traditional setting.

    Background

    Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) preparations have been traditionally used in
    Southeast Asia for its medicinal properties. Lately, Kratom use has spread
    to Europe and the US, where abuse potential and health hazards increasingly
    emerge. This study is the first to measure systematically Kratom dependence,
    withdrawal symptoms, and drug craving in regular Kratom users in Malaysia.

    Methods

    A cross-sectional survey of 293 regular Kratom users was conducted in the
    community across three northern peninsular states of Malaysia. The Leeds
    Dependence Questionnaire, Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist, and Marijuana
    Craving Questionnaire-Short Form were used to measure Kratom dependence,
    withdrawal and craving.

    Results

    More than half of the regular users (>6 month of use) developed severe
    Kratom dependence problems, while 45% showed a moderate Kratom dependence.
    Physical withdrawal symptoms commonly experienced include muscle spasms and
    pain, sleeping difficulty, watery eyes/nose, hot flashes, fever, decreased
    appetite, and diarrhoea. Psychological withdrawal symptoms commonly reported
    were restlessness, tension, anger, sadness, and nervousness. The average
    amount of the psychoactive compound, mitragynine, in a single dose of a
    Kratom drink was 79mg, suggesting an average daily intake of 276.5mg.
    Regular users who consumed ≥3 glasses Kratom per day, had higher odds of
    developing severe Kratom dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and inability to
    control Kratom craving.

    Conclusions

    The findings from this study show that regular Kratom use is associated with
    drug dependency, development of withdrawal symptoms, and craving. These
    symptoms become more severe with prolonged use and suggest a stronger
    control of the drug.

  abstract: >-
    Kratom leaves (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) are traditionally used in
    Southeast Asia for their medicinal value. Self-report studies suggest that
    cessation from chronic kratom tea consumption (freshly brewed kratom tea)
    was associated with unpleasant psychological symptoms. This study sought to
    assess the severity of anxiety and depression during kratom cessation.
    Regular kratom users (N = 150) were recruited from the northern state of
    Penang (Malaysia) for this retrospective study. The Beck Depression
    Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scales were used to assess
    the severity of the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Most respondents
    (70%) experienced symptoms of mild anxiety, while 81% experienced symptoms
    of mild depression during kratom cessation. Those who consumed higher
    quantities of kratom tea daily (≥4 glasses) had higher odds of reporting
    longer duration of kratom use history (OR = 4.8, 95% CI 2.3 −10.1, p <
    0.001), higher frequency of daily kratom use (≥4 times) (OR = 72, CI 9.5–
    543.1, p < 0.001), and were more likely to experience moderate symptoms of
    depression (OR = 2.9, CI 1.1–7.3, p = 0.020) during kratom cessation than
    those who consumed between one and three glasses of kratom tea per day.
    Cessation from regular and long-term kratom tea consumption was not
    associated with symptoms of high anxiety or depression.

    Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) is traditionally used in Southeast Asia
    for its medicinal value and psychoactive properties. Nonetheless, cessation
    from regular kratom use is reported to cause unpleasant dose-dependent
    withdrawal symptoms. This study aims to evaluate the severity of pain and
    sleep problems following the cessation of kratom tea/juice consumption among
    regular kratom users. A total of 170 regular users were recruited through
    snowball sampling for this cross-sectional study. The Brief Pain Inventory
    (BPI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scales were administered to
    assess the severity of pain and sleep problems. Most participants
    experienced moderate pain intensity (84%) and moderate pain interference
    (70%) during kratom cessation; 46% experienced more sleep problems during
    kratom cessation. Individuals who consumed ≥4 glasses of kratom tea/juice
    (about 76–115 mg of mitragynine) daily had higher odds of reporting some
    pain interference (OR: 2.0; CI: 1.04–3.93: p < .028), and sleep problems
    during kratom cessation (OR: 2.0; CI: 1.08–3.68: p < .020), as compared to
    those who consumed 1–3 glasses of kratom tea/juice daily. However, the
    effects were still relatively mild. Cessation from regular kratom tea/juice
    consumption is not associated with prolonged pain and sleep problems, as
    compared to those reported for opioid analgesics.

  abstract: >-
    Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is an indigenous plant known for its traditional
    medicinal use, and for its addiction potential, in Southeast Asia. In recent
    years, kratom and its major alkaloid, mitragynine, spread worldwide with
    largely unknown effects on behavior and mental health. Recent studies show
    that kratom use can lead to dependence and that mitragynine works as an
    addictive drug in animal studies. Nevertheless, kratom preparations were
    also suggested as a less harmful substitute in opiate withdrawal. Potential
    side-effects of prolonged kratom use, however, are currently unclear. The
    aim of this study was to investigate the social functioning of regular
    kratom users in Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in three
    northern states of Peninsular Malaysia investigating 293 regular kratom
    consumers using the Addiction Severity Index in a snowball sampling
    technique. Findings showed that regular kratom users do not experience major
    impairments in their social functioning, despite being dependent on kratom
    for prolonged periods. Our findings suggest that chronic kratom
    administration does not significantly impair social functioning of users in
    a natural context in Malaysia.

    Introduction: 

    The objective of the paper was to highlight the differences in the
    traditional and non-traditional users of kratom in the South East Asian and
    Western contexts.


    Method:

    A literature survey of published kratom studies among humans was conducted.
    Forty published studies relevant to the objective were reviewed.


    Results:

    Apart from the differences in the sources of supply, patterns of use and
    social acceptability of kratom within these two regions, the most
    interesting finding is its evolution to a recreational drug in both settings
    and the severity of the adverse effects of kratom use reported in the West.
    While several cases of toxicity and death have emerged in the West, such
    reports have been non-existent in South East Asia where kratom has had a
    longer history of use. We highlight the possible reasons for this as
    discussed in the literature. More importantly, it should be borne in mind
    that the individual clinical case-reports emerging from the West that link
    kratom use to adverse reactions or fatalities frequently pertained to kratom
    used together with other substances. Therefore, there is a danger of these
    reports being used to strengthen the case for legal sanction against kratom.
    This would be unfortunate since the experiences from South East Asia suggest
    considerable potential for therapeutic use among people who use drugs.


    Conclusion:

    Despite its addictive properties, reported side-effects and its tendency to
    be used a recreational drug, more scientific clinical human studies are
    necessary to determine its potential therapeutic value.

  abstract: >-
    Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a psychoactive plant that has been used since
    at least 1836 in folk medicine in Southeast Asian countries. More recently,
    kratom has become widely available in the West and is used for both
    recreational and medicinal purposes. There has, however, been little
    scientific research into the short- and long-term effects of kratom in
    humans, and much of the information available is anecdotal. To supplement
    the increasing scientific understanding of kratom's pharmacology and
    research into its effects in animals, we report the results of a qualitative
    analysis of first-hand descriptions of human kratom use that were submitted
    to, and published by, a psychoactive substance information website
    (Erowid.org). Themes that emerged from these experience reports indicate
    that kratom may be useful for analgesia, mood elevation, anxiety reduction,
    and may aid opioid withdrawal management. Negative response themes also
    emerged, indicating potential problems and unfavorable "side" effects,
    especially stomach upset and vomiting. Based on our analyses, we present
    preliminary hypotheses for future examination in controlled, quantitative
    studies of kratom.

    Background

    Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a psychoactive plant native to Southeastern
    Asia that is receiving increased international attention as a potential
    therapeutic agent. While much of the limited scientific research on kratom
    is focused on its analgesic potential, kratom use also has important risks
    and benefits in the domain of mental health.

    Methods

    We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of all studies on kratom use
    and mental health published between January 1960 and July 2017.

    Results

    Findings indicate kratom’s potential as a harm reduction tool, most notably
    as a substitute for opioids among people who are addicted. Kratom also
    enhances mood and relieves anxiety among many users. For many, kratom’s
    negative mental health effects – primarily withdrawal symptoms – appear to
    be mild relative to those of opioids. For some users, however, withdrawal is
    highly uncomfortable and maintaining abstinence becomes difficult.

    Conclusion

    Results inform clinicians working in the mental health and substance use
    fields, policy-makers, and researchers about the mental health effects of
    this plant.

    Kratom, known botanically as Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.), is an indigenous
    tree in Southeast Asia. Kratom is currently easily available worldwide via
    special shops and the Internet to use as a drug of abuse, opioid
    alternative, or pain killer. So far, the pharmacokinetics of this plant has
    been studied only in animals, and there is no such study in humans. The
    major abundant active alkaloid in Kratom, mitragynine, is one of the
    promising new chemical substances to be developed as a new drug. The aim of
    this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of mitragynine and assess the
    linearity in pharmacokinetics in chronic users.

    Since Kratom is illegal in Thailand, studies in healthy subjects would be
    unethical. We therefore conducted a prospective study by enrolling ten
    chronic, regular, healthy users. We adjusted the steady state in each
    subject by giving a known amount of Kratom tea for 7 days before
    commencement of the experiment. We admitted and gave different oral doses to
    subjects to confirm linearity in pharmacokinetics. The mitragynine blood
    concentrations at 17 times points and the urine concentrations during the
    24-hour period were collected and measured by liquid chromatography-tandem
    mass spectrometry method.

    Ten male subjects completed the study without adverse reactions. The median
    duration of abuse was 1.75 years. We analyzed one subject separately due to
    the abnormal behavior of blood concentration. From data of nine subjects,
    the pharmacokinetic parameters established were time to reach the maximum
    plasma concentration (0.83±0.35 hour), terminal half-life (23.24±16.07
    hours), and the apparent volume of distribution (38.04±24.32 L/kg). The
    urine excretion of unchanged form was 0.14%. The pharmacokinetics were
    observed to be oral two-compartment model.

    This was the first pharmacokinetic study in humans, which demonstrated
    linearity and was consistent with the oral two-compartment model with a
    terminal half-life of about 1 day. The pharmacokinetic linearity and
    parameters reported are necessary pharmacological information of Kratom, and
    there is a possibility for it to be developed medically as a pain killer or
    better opioid substitute in the future.

    Mitragynine, an indole alkaloid from Thai folk medicine Mitragyna speciosa,
    exerts agonistic effects on opioid receptors. Gastric acid secretion is
    proposed to be regulated by opioid receptors in the central nervous system
    (CNS). Previously, we reported the dual roles (inhibition via micro-opioid
    receptors and stimulation via kappa-opioid receptors) of the opioid system
    in the central control of gastric acid secretion. We investigated whether
    mitragynine affects gastric acid secretion via opioid receptors in the CNS.
    Injection of mitragynine (30 microg) alone into the lateral cerebroventricle
    did not have a significant effect on basal gastric acid secretion in the
    perfused stomach of anesthetized rats. Injection of mitragynine (3-30
    microg) into the fourth cerebroventricle, like morphine, inhibited
    2-deoxy-D-glucose-stimulated gastric acid secretion. The inhibitory effect
    of mitragynine (30 microg) was reversed by naloxone (100 microg). These
    results suggest that mitragynine has a morphine-like action on gastric acid
    secretion in the CNS.

  abstract: >-
    Kratom or Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.) is an evergreen tree of the coffee
    family native to South-East Asia and Australasia. It is used by locals
    recreationally to induce stimulant and sedative effects and medically to
    soothe pain and opiate withdrawal. Its leaves are smoked, chewed, or
    infused, or ground to yield powders or extracts for use as liquids. It
    contains more than 40 alkaloids; among these, mitragynine and
    7-hydroxymitragynine are endowed with variable mu, delta, and kappa opioid
    stimulating properties (with 7-hydroxymitragynine having a more balanced
    affinity), rhynchophylline, which is a non-competitive NMDA glutamate
    receptor antagonist, but is present in negligible quantities, and raubasine,
    which inhibits α1-adrenceptors preferentially over α2-adrenceptors, while
    the latter are bound by 7-hydroxymitragynine, while mitragynine counters
    5-HT2A receptors. This complexity of neurochemical mechanisms may account
    for kratom's sedative-analgesic and stimulant effects. It is commonly held
    that kratom at low doses is stimulant and at higher doses sedative, but no
    cut-off has been possible to define. Long-term use of kratom may produce
    physical and psychological effects that are very similar to its withdrawal
    syndrome, that is, anxiety, irritability, mood, eating, and sleep disorders,
    other than physical symptoms resembling opiate withdrawal. Kratom's
    regulatory status varies across countries; in Italy, both mitragynine and
    the entire tree and its parts are included among regulated substances. We
    describe the case of a patient who developed anxiety and dysphoric mood and
    insomnia while using kratom, with these symptoms persisting after
    withdrawal. He did not respond to a variety of antidepressant combinations
    and tramadol for various months, and responded after 1 month of
    clomipramine. Well-being persisted after discontinuing tramadol.

  abstract: >-
    Mitragyna speciosa (Rubiaceae), commonly known as kratom, is a tropical tree
    with a long history of traditional use in parts of Africa and Southeast
    Asia. In recent years, kratom has gained popularity for use as a
    recreational drug across the globe. Relatively new to the illicit market and
    used in a manner different from its traditional applications, preparations
    of kratom are touted by many as a safe and legal psychoactive product that
    improves mood, relieves pain, and may provide benefits in opiate addiction.
    Available literature was reviewed for M. speciosa via PubMed, Google
    Scholar, CINAHL, and EBSCO to summarize its traditional uses, phytochemical
    composition, pharmacology and toxicology of proposed active constituents,
    and potential for misuse and abuse. Research has demonstrated that both
    stimulant and sedative dose-dependent effects do exist, but a growing
    concern for the drug’s effects and safety of use has resulted in national
    and international attention primarily due to an increase in hospital visits
    and deaths in several countries that are said to have been caused by
    extracts of the plant. The main active alkaloid substances in kratom,
    mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, present with a range of CNS stimulant
    and depressant effects mediated primarily through monoaminergic and opioid
    receptors. Recently, Palm Beach County, located in the southeastern corridor
    of Florida, has considered regulating kratom due to public safety concerns
    following the death of a young adult. At the local, state, and even federal
    levels, governments are now being confronted with the task of determining
    the safety and the possible regulation of kratom extracts. There are
    currently no standard analytical screening techniques for mitragynine and
    its metabolites following ingestion limiting its detection to more
    sophisticated techniques like liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to
    determine kratom use. The growing concern of the abuse potential of kratom
    requires careful evaluation of its benefits and potential toxicities.

    PURPOSE: This article reviews the pharmacology, clinical utility, adverse
    effects, and abuse potential of kratom.

    SUMMARY: The leaves of Mitragyna speciosa contain the biologically active
    alkaloids of kratom. Kratom exerts opioid and α-2 receptor agonistic effects
    as well as antiinflammatory and parasympathetic-impeding effects. There are
    no published human pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, or drug interaction
    studies on kratom or mitragynine, making it virtually impossible to fully
    understand kratom's therapeutic potential and risks and the populations most
    likely to benefit or experience harm from its use. Kratom has been used to
    ameliorate opioid withdrawal symptoms but also induces withdrawal. Human
    pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and clinical data are of low quality,
    precluding any firm conclusions regarding safety and efficacy. Respiratory
    depression has not been commonly reported, but kratom does cause a host of
    adverse effects without clear guidance for how they should be treated. There
    are numerous assessments where people have been unable to stop using kratom
    therapy, and withdrawal signs and symptoms are problematic. Kratom does not
    appear in normal drug screens and, when taken with other substances of
    abuse, may not be recognized. Thirty-six deaths have been attributed to
    kratom, and the Food and Drug Administration issued a public health warning
    about the substance in November 2017.

    CONCLUSION: Kratom exerts opioid and α-2 receptor agonistic effects as well
    as antiinflammatory and parasympathetic-impeding effects. Human
    pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and clinical data are of low quality,
    precluding any firm conclusions regarding safety and efficacy.

  abstract: >-
    Kratom exerts opioid and alpha-2 agonistic effects, as well as
    anti-inflammatory and mild stimulant effects. Respiratory depression has not
    been commonly reported, but kratom does cause a host of adverse effects.
    While kratom may have a role in patients who are in chronic pain or
    dependent on opioid painkillers or heroin, this needs to be established in
    clinical trials. Kratom may have drug interactions as both a cytochrome
    P-450 system substrate and inhibitor. Kratom does not appear in normal drug
    screens and, especially when ingested with other substances of abuse, may
    not be recognized as an agent of harm. There are numerous cases of death in
    kratom users, but many involved polypharmaceutical ingestions. There are
    assessments where people have been unable to stop using kratom therapy and
    withdrawal signs/symptoms occurred in patients or their newborn babies after
    kratom cessation. Both banning and failure to ban kratom places people at
    risk; a middle-ground alternative, placing it behind the pharmacy counter,
    might be useful.

    Mitragynine is a major psychoactive alkaloid in leaves of kratom (Mitragyna
    speciosa Korth.). To understand its disposition in organs, this study aimed
    to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that
    predicts mitragynine concentrations in plasma and organ of interests in rats
    and humans. The PBPK model consisted of six organ compartments (i.e. lung,
    brain, liver, fat, slowly perfused tissues, and rapidly perfused tissue).
    From systematic searching, three pharmacokinetic studies of mitragynine (two
    studies in rats and 1 study in humans) were retrieved from the literature.
    Berkeley Madonna Software (version 8.3.18) was used for model development
    and model simulation. The developed PBPK model consisted of biologically
    relevant features following involvement of (i) breast cancer-resistant
    protein (BCRP) in brain, (ii) a hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4
    (CYP3A4)-mediated metabolism in the liver, and (iii) a diffusion-limited
    transport in fat. The simulations adequately describe simulated and observed
    data in the two species with different dosing regimens. PBPK models of
    mitragynine in rats and humans were successfully developed. The models may
    be used to guide optimal mitragynine dosing regimens.

    Mitragynine is the major psychoactive alkaloid of the plant kratom/ketum.
    Kratom is widely used in Southeast Asia as a recreational drug, and
    increasingly appears as a pure compound or a component of 'herbal high'
    preparations in the Western world. While mitragynine/kratom may have
    analgesic, muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory effects, its addictive
    properties and effects on cognitive performance are unknown. We isolated
    mitragynine from the plant and performed a thorough investigation of its
    behavioural effects in rats and mice. Here we describe an addictive profile
    and cognitive impairments of acute and chronic mitragynine administration,
    which closely resembles that of morphine. Acute mitragynine has complex
    effects on locomotor activity. Repeated administration induces locomotor
    sensitization, anxiolysis and conditioned place preference, enhances
    expression of dopamine transporter- and dopamine receptor-regulating factor
    mRNA in the mesencephalon. While there was no increase in spontaneous
    locomotor activity during withdrawal, animals showed hypersensitivity
    towards small challenging doses for up to 14 days. Severe somatic withdrawal
    signs developed after 12 hours, and increased level of anxiety became
    evident after 24 hours of withdrawal. Acute mitragynine independently
    impaired passive avoidance learning, memory consolidation and retrieval,
    possibly mediated by a disruption of cortical oscillatory activity,
    including the suppression of low-frequency rhythms (delta and theta) in the
    electrocorticogram. Chronic mitragynine administration led to impaired
    passive avoidance and object recognition learning. Altogether, these
    findings provide evidence for an addiction potential with cognitive
    impairments for mitragynine, which suggest its classification as a harmful
    drug.
