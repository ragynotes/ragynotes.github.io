> *Some Medicinal Products from the Straits Settlements* — E. M. Holmes says that Biab, which was believed to belong to the genus Nauclea, is now considered by him to be *Mitragyna speciosa*. Prual does not belong to either of the Rubaceous genera, Lasianthus or Urophyllum. Stapf will shortly publish an account of his identification of the species. Ipoh Aker is supposed by Holmes to more nearly approach *Strychnos wakkuchiana*. Poison
