Prual does not belong to either of the Rubaceous genera, Lasianthus or Urophyllum. Stapf will shortly publish an account of his identification of the species. Ipoh Aker is supposed by Holmes to more nearly approach \u003cem\u003eStrychnos wakkuchiana\u003c/em\u003e.

It was more largely grown in this province than\nanything else in comparison with their respective values. Various causes\nhave lately conduced to a decided falhng off in the cultivation of the\npoppy Ina good year the total output of Yezd was some 1200 cases,\neach case weighing about 130 Ibs. An average output would be about\n1000 to 1200 cases. In speaking of the opium of Verd is included not\nalone that only grown in the province, but also that produced m Khoras-\nsan, Tabbas, and even in the Herat district. â€˜The crude stuff is sent to\nYezd, where it is manufactured. During the past year, viz., 1891-2, the\ncrop has been but a small one. â€˜The prices ruhng in China and London\nwere low and not remunerative, consequently only about half the usual\namount was sown in the Yezd district, and this more for speculatwe pur-\nposes than for anything else. â€˜To still further reduce the output, the crop,\nfor want of proper spring rams, was a practical failure Hence, the maxi-\nmum quantity of opium manufactured in Yezd was somewhat under 500\ncases. One hundred and eighty-two pounds of the crnde material in\nYerd makes one case of 130 Ibs. manufactured article. Of Khorassanâ€™s \u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n"
